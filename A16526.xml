            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe few Sermons, which at the first were meant but vnto a few, I haue now publiſhed and made common vnto others: not onely that by this meanes the doctrine and conſolation contained in them, might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed vnto the firſt hearers (which for them <hi>is a ſure thing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.1.</note> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh;) but that according to the Communion of Saints, as in the naturall bodie,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> that gift which is in any part, the reſt haue the vſe of it; ſo in the myſticall bodie of Chriſt, that which he by his spirit, and by his owne ordinance had made proper vnto ſome, others might haue the fruit and benefit of the
<pb facs="tcp:7191:5"/> ſame. For ſeeing we be all alike ſubiect vnto the ſame corruption and vnbeliefe in our ſoules, and there is no temptation appertaining vnto man, but euery one may fall into it, as well as another: there is no inſtruction or comfort out of the word of God, which any haue receiued, but the reſt of the ſeruants of God may receiue the like from thence: especially ſeeing they proceede from one and the ſame ſpirit of truth and of life, which quickening the whole bodie, worketh in euery member proportionably. Therefore as I am not altogether out of hope, that others may bee benefited by them, beſides thoſe for whom they were first prepared: ſo if they be, J ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent me of this double labour; the one in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of them, and the other in publiſhing of them. I haue intituled them, <hi>Medicines for the Plague,</hi> becauſe they containe many medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations fit for that euill, both to preuent it, and to beare it patiently, and to be recouered out of it, and to die comfortably in it. And I muſt needs confeſſe, that I did not make choice of this text, to intreat of that argument of purpoſe, for then I might haue taken many other more fit in the Scripture; and this (to ſay the truth) doth not properly concerne it one whit: but hauing entred
<pb facs="tcp:7191:6"/> into this Pſalme, before there was any great ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of the Plague, vpon this occaſion of the Kings Highneſſe his firſt comming into theſe parts of his dominion, and ſo in the beginning handling ſomething of our dutie vnto our ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne prince, according to the generall drift of the text; when this new accident of the Plague fell out, becauſe the Pſalme did still ſo farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the time, as it was a time of trouble, I held on my courſe, and made a vertue of neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and ſo did applie the Scripture vnto the time, and all meditations of trouble ariſing out of it vnto this one kind of trouble of the Plague eſpecially, proper vnto that time, ſo far as it was neceſſarie. And ſo during the time of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke faſts, commaunded by publicke authoritie, and generally vſed for the moſt part euery where, continuing in this text, as the Plague encreaſed, ſo in my whole courſe I did still aime at that more and more. Whereupon it commeth to paſſe, that the <hi>Medicines for the Plague</hi> (ſo called) are inſerted ſomewhat after the beginning, and ſo more towards the middeſt, and in the end moſt of all, according to the time. Therefore though this one thing be not diſperſed through the whole booke, and in euery Sermon, (though it be in the
<pb facs="tcp:7191:6"/> moſt) the whole booke not vnfitly hath his deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination thereof: euen as ſome compound medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are called not of all, but of one principall ingredient, and that alſo which in the artificiall confection is added to the reſt in the middeſt, or rather ſometimes euen at the laſt. And as the ſame Apothecaries, though they haue more of that ſtuffe remaining, put to no more than is fit at that time for the preſent receit: ſo though there was more of this Pſalme remaining vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handled, yet I left it off, when the Lord in ſo great mercie did put an end almoſt to the Plague, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the chiefe parts of this realme; at what time alſo all men did diſcontinue their weekely fasting. And though I meant nothing leſſe at the firſt preaching of them, than that they ſhould thus be divulged; yet ſeeing the Lord did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards put it into my mind (as I am perſuaded) and gaue me good ſucceſſe by his bleſsing in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them downe in writing, J doe not repent me of this labour. And it ſhall not be vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for vs all by this meanes ſo long after, both to remember in what caſe we were then, to be still humbled by it; and what we then prayed for, that now wee may be thankefull; and what wee then vowed, that now we may performe it: and that
<pb facs="tcp:7191:7"/> we may be prepared for the like againe. And thus hoping of your Christian patience and charitable iudgement of theſe my indeuors, and of my good meaning in them, I commend them to your godly conſideration, with my prayers for you, and for them, vnto him, who onely giueth encreaſe to the planting and watering of all men according to his heauenly wiſdome;<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.</note> and deſire you alſo, that you would further me with your prayers this way, and euery way, that ſo we may all of vs receiue as much as we giue, according to the promiſe of our Sauiour Chriſt,<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Pſalme (as appeareth by the inſcription) was made by the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The author of this Pſalme: and to whom it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</note> as moſt of the Pſalmes were; and not as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate thing belonging to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alone, but for the benefit of the whole Church, as the reſt of the Scriptures alſo were written to that end: and therefore it was deliuered, or ſpecially by him commended, vnto him that excelleth; namely in Muſicke; that is, vnto one of the Leuites, that was skilfull in Muſicke, to bee ſung publikely in the Temple, and therefore by him to bee ſet vnto ſome tune fit for it: according to the manner of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7191:8"/> Gods worſhip in thoſe daies, and according to the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the offices of the Leuites made by <hi>Dauid,</hi> for all kinde of Muſicke, both with voyce, and with diuers kinds of inſtruments:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.</note> as appeareth in the booke of the Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. And the whole Pſalme thus made and directed, is a prayer of the Church for <hi>Dauid</hi> their King.<note place="margin">The argument of this Pſalme.</note> For in the beginning, and end of the Pſalme there are the words of ſupplication and prayer, deſiring ſome thing of the Lord: in the middeſt they ſhew with what faith they do pray. And it is euident that they pray not for themſelues onely, but for another: for they ſay, <hi>The Lord heare thee, and defend thee, &amp;c.</hi> and they meane their King, whom in the ſixt verſe they call <hi>the Lords annointed:</hi> it was made by <hi>Dauid,</hi> as appeareth by the title. He then teacheth the people to pray for himſelfe, deſireth their prayers, telleth them for what they ſhould pray, and giueth them a forme of it.<note place="margin">The occaſion of it.</note> The time when he made this prayer for them, and the occaſion of it is not ſet downe in the title, as it is in ſome other Pſalmes: but yet it is thought by diuers, that it was when hee went to battell againſt the Ammonites. Which thing as it is but coniecturall, ſo we are ſure of this out of the words of the text, that it was in a time of great daunger, not onely to his owne perſon, as appeareth in the firſt and ſecond verſes: but to the whole realm, as is euident verſ. 7.8: and it was a time of war, for they ſpeake of chariots and horſes as of meanes of defence, verſ. 7. He then in a matter of great moment fleeth to God for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, as to his only defence: he vſeth all good meanes, but repoſeth his whole confidence in Gods defence: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee prayeth to him before he beginneth any thing, and determineth further in the whole courſe of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſtil to pray vnto God for direction and aide: And not onely to doe it a little at the firſt, as may appeare out of the verſe.<note place="margin">Dauid did de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſire the people to pray for him.</note> 1.3.4: but becauſe it concerned not himſelfe alone, but all the people, and finding his owne inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in prayer, and beleeuing the promiſes of God made vnto the prayer of other, eſpecially of the Church, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7191:8"/> them to pray for him, and namely to pray that God would heare his prayers, which what they were or ſhould be in particular they knew not, but generally they might preſume that they were good, and ſuch as did concerne that action: and ſo whatſoeuer they were, he would haue them pray to God that he would heare them: as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth verſ. 4.</p>
               <p>The people doe according to this direction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of his;<note place="margin">The Prophet did vſe this forme of prayer for him.</note> for they vſed this forme of prayer which hee had preſcribed, and ſo did pray earneſtly for him, that God would both heare his prayer, and defend his perſon, and to that end ſend him helpe from heauen, and declare by the euent that hee had heard his and their prayers, in giuing them victorie ouer their enemies: and God heareth them all, and ſaueth the king, confoundeth their enemies, cauſeth them to returne home with victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and great triumph, as appeareth by the next Pſalme: wherein he and they together giue thanks vnto God for the victorie, attributing it onely to God, and not to their owne ſtrength, or any power of man; as in this Pſalme they had profeſſed, that they did not truſt in chariots and horſes, and ſuch warlike defence, as men vſe to doe, and namely their enemies did, but only in the protection and defence of God, which by calling vpon his name they ſought for. And ſo this is the generall argument and ſumme of this Pſalme, both in reſpect of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who made this prayer, and of the people who did vſe it for him.</p>
               <p>By the inſcription then it appeareth, that <hi>Dauid</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this prayer for the people to vſe in his behalfe, was deſirous that they ſhould pray for him, and did as it were ſeek it at their hands. If he in ſo good a cauſe did not reſt in the confidence of his own prayers, but deſired others to pray for him; and if he did it then, when he had ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny means to accompliſh his deſire, becauſe he knew God to be aboue them, and ſo as without him they could doe nothing, and hee was able to hinder and to fruſtrate all;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7191:9"/> and if hee that was ſo well able to pray for himſelfe and others, yet did deſire the prayer of others, &amp; of thoſe that were inferiour vnto him:<note place="margin">Kings ought to take order that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould publikly pray for them.</note> Then no King, Prince, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate is exempted from this, to ſtand in neede of the prayer of others: and therefore they ought to take order in their ſeuerall realmes and dominions, that the people may vſually pray for them in their publike places and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies: and more ſeriouſlie and particularly to doe it, as there ſhall bee any ſpeciall occaſion, as here was in the time of <hi>Dauid.</hi> Therefore this order that is among vs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by lawe, that in all Churches the Miniſter and people are willed to pray continually for the Kings moſt excellent Maieſtie, both in common prayer and in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; and that as warre, or other thing ſhall fall out, ſo ſome ſpeciall formes of prayer are ſet out by publike au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to bee vſed in ſuch caſes: is according to Gods word, and to the example of godly Princes. I ſpeake not now of our duties to pray for them, but of theirs, that they ſhould thinke that they neede it, and ſo require it of the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Al men ought to deſire o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to pray for them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeuerall neede.</note>And if Kings are bound thus to doe, then Noblemen, and other inferiour perſons much more, who haue not ſo many meanes to accompliſh their owne deſires, or it may be are not ſo well able to pray for themſelues, at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as <hi>Dauid</hi> was. And ſo generally all men (for this, as well as the reſt of the Scripture is written for our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) are bound, as at all other times to deſire others to pray for them; ſo alſo, as they ſhall haue any ſpeciall cauſe, to deſire them to doe it a great deale more: and not only to pray themſelues for themſelues continually, becauſe prayer in all things is our ſpeciall refuge and ſuccour; but to deſire others to pray God, that he would from time to time heare their prayers. And as <hi>Dauid</hi> doth it here in this ſpeciall neede of his, as being in danger and feare of his enemies: ſo if we be in ſicknes and feare of death, we ſhould in the feeling of our own weaknes, and in the faith of the prayers of others, deſire the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to pray for vs, and not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7191:9"/> only to pray our ſelues. And this is the aduice and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Apoſtle: <hi>Is any among you afflicted?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13.14.</note> 
                  <hi>let him pray: is any ſicke among you? let him call for the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church, and let them pray for him.</hi> Now ſeeing ſicknes is but one kind of croſſe, and the Lord hath many waies elſe to afflict vs; in any of them we ought to do the like: yea and not only when affliction is vpon vs, that it might be remoued and taken away; but when wee haue iuſt cauſe to feare it, that it might be preuented, and ſo we eſcape it. And not onely in outward affliction, but all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward much more, by how much they are more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and grieuous: as if wee ſhall be diſtreſſed in minde, being tempted by Sathan either vnto ſinne, or for ſinne: for if they be auailable in other caſes, then in theſe. And ſo to conclude this one point in a word, in euery matter that is of any importance either for our ſelues, or for any of ours, wee ought ſo to commend the ſame, and the whole ſucceſſe of them vnto God in prayer, who muſt onely bring them to paſſe, as that we reſt not therein, but deſire alſo the prayers of others to helpe vs in the ſame.</p>
               <p>This ordinance of his,<note place="margin">By this God would haue vs vnited in loue one to another.</note> the Lord in much wiſedome and mercie hath left, to vnite vs in brotherly loue one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that when we ſhall ſee by experience how much we are or may be beholding one to another, in that by their prayers wee haue been holpen in ſo great diſtreſſes, wee might from the bottome of our harts vnfainedly loue one another. Thus the greateſt Monarch may be beholding to all his ſubiects, as <hi>Dauid</hi> was here to his people; and the rich this way may thinke that they faire the better for the poore; and the Miniſter for the meaneſt of his flocke; And it were well that this way wee were all of vs a great deale more beholding one to another than we are: in that we would in brotherly loue acquaint others with our eſtate, and deſire their prayers, and then they would pray for vs, according to the counſell and aduice of the Apoſtle: <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge your faults one to another, and pray one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>that ye may be healed, for the prayer of a righteous man
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7191:10"/> auaileth much, if it be feruent.</hi> If we ſhould for our owne benefit and good, acquaint other with ſome ſpeciall ſins, that haue been the cauſe (and ſo conſequently that may bee the cauſe) of ſome great croſſe; that they vpon the knowledge of it might in greater feeling and faith pray for vs, that they might bee forgiuen, and wee deliuered from the puniſhment of them: then ſhould wee make them acquainted with other of our neceſſities to that end much more.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">As in other things wee need the help one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo in prayer: and therefore ſhould deſire the ſame.</note>And that wee might bee perſwaded vnto this duty of crauing the prayers of others in the feeling of the great need that we haue of them; let vs firſt of all conſider, how the Lord hath ſo made vs all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he would haue vs helpe one another, and know that we neede the help one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, both for ſoule and bodie and euery way elſe: and therefore that we ſhould ſeeke for it one of another; as in the naturall bodie all parts doe need the mutuall helpe one of another, as the eyes of the feete, and the belly of the hands, and doe in a ſort ſeeke vnto them for it, and by a naturall inſtinct, as it were begge and craue it. And all experience teacheth vs, that in all other things none of vs is ſufficient of our ſelues, and therefore we craue the help of others, as in counſell, in labour, and in all worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires; why then ſhould it not be ſo in praier alſo? Yet ſuch is our corruption, that we rather ſeeke helpe in any thing, as diſtruſting our ſelues, ſauing in this, wherein wee moſt neede it. But we haue found the other true by our owne experience, and ſo doe vſe it, if we did beleeue this, and would doe thereafter, wee might finde the fruite of it as ſenſible.<note place="margin">We deſire men to ſue for vs to Princes, ſo ſhould wee do vnto God.</note> Secondly, when we haue ſuites vnto Princes or great men, we deſire thoſe that are in fauour with them, to further our ſuites, and thoſe eſpecially that are moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious with them; and wee reſt not in our ſelues, though we be well knowne vnto them, eſpecially if the matter that wee ſue for bee of any moment: why ſhould wee not then much more ſpeak vnto others, that they would pray to God for vs, and commend our ſuites vnto his high Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie?
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7191:10"/> For though Gods loue be not partiall, as mans is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20.</note> but his promiſe is to all alike: yet experience ſheweth that ſome are more acquainted with prayer, then other, and ſo haue more acceſſe vnto God, as it were, and come oftner into his preſence, and neerer vnto him, and ſo there is more hope that they ſhould bee ſooner heard. Eſpeciallie when God hath made a ſpeciall promiſe, that when two or three bee gathered together in the name of his ſonne, hee will be in the middeſt of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when diuers, or the whole Church pray for vs, there is more hope of being heard, than when wee pray our ſelues alone. The Papiſts pray to the Saints, that are dead, that they would pray to God for them, that hee would heare their prayers; for which there is no warrant in the Scripture, but the whole word of God is rather againſt them: but here is an example to deſire the prayers of the Saints on earth that are liuing, with hope of great fruite; and few do follow it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when we pray,<note place="margin">When wee wraſtle with men we deſire help: ſo ſhould wee when wee ſtriue in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24.</note> we doe as it were ſtriue with God to obtaine ſome thing, as was ſhewed to <hi>Iacob</hi> in the viſion of an Angell wraſtling with him all night long; to teach vs, that when we pray we muſt not come coldly or ſleepely vnto it, but with all earneſtnes of deſire, and not giue ouer vntill the Lord bleſſe vs, as <hi>Iacob</hi> would not let the Angell goe, vntill he bleſſed him: and then the Lord will aſſuredly bleſſe vs, if we perſeuere, as he did <hi>Iacob;</hi> and as Chriſt hath ſhewed in the parable of the wicked Iudge, who was ouercome by the importunitie of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. Therefore as when we wraſtle or ſtriue with a man,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.2.</note> we knowing his great ſtrength and our owne weakenes, and ſo how hard it is to ouercome, we would gladly haue others to helpe and to ſtriue with vs againſt him; and ſo we may more eaſily do that by the helpe of others, which alone hardly, or not at all we could do: So when we ſtriue with the Lord God in prayer, being priuie to the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our owne faith, and how many ſinnes there are to hinder vs, and what an hard thing it is to obtaine any
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7191:11"/> thing in reſpect of our great vnworthineſſe, we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire others to helpe vs with their prayers, and therein as it were to ſtriue with vs. And in this reſpect it is a ſingular great bleſſing, if it were rightly eſteemed, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſed, to haue many in a familie, or in the Church, to pray with vs, and for vs.</p>
               <p>Thus ſpeaketh the Apoſtle, and thus did hee practiſe, when hee ſo earneſtly intreated the Romanes to pray for him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.30. 32.</note> ſaying, <hi>Brethren, I beſeech you for our Lord Ieſus Chriſts ſake, and for the loue of the ſpirit, that you would ſtriue with me by prayer to God for me; that I may come to you with ioy by the will of God, and may with you bee refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</hi> He had often, and of a long time purpoſed to come to them,<note place="margin">Chap. 1.10.</note> as he profeſſeth in the firſt chapter; and prayed, that by ſome meanes one time or other he might haue proſperous iourney by the will of God to come vnto them:<note place="margin">Paul deſired the Church to ſtriue with him in prayer.</note> now at the laſt he deſireth them alſo not only to pray, but to pray earneſtly, and to ſtriue with him in their prayers, that he may come with ioy: and doth beſeech them that they would doe ſo, euen for the loue of Chriſt, and of the ſpirit. If hee then after ſo many and earneſt prayers did deſire them to ſtriue with him: how had we need much more to doe it, who pray ſeldomer, and more coldly? And truly as great things may be done, when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtriue together, which none of them could ſeuerally doe: ſo by the prayers of many great things are obtained, which by the prayers of one alone are not ſo eaſily gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So the ſame Apoſtle writeth to the Corinthians, that God had deliuered him from great dangers, and would doe ſo ſtill,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8.</note> ſo that they would pray earneſtly for him: <hi>Brethren,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we would not haue you ignorant of our affliction, which came vnto vs in Aſia, how we were preſſed out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, paſſing ſtrength, ſo that we altogether doubted euen of life. Yea, we receiued the ſentence of death in our ſelues, becauſe wee ſhould not truſt in our ſelues, but in God, who raiſeth the dead. Who deliuered vs from ſo great a death, and doth deliuer vs: in whom we truſt, that yet hereafter he will deliuer vs; ſo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7191:11"/> that yee labour together in prayer for vs.</hi> Thus he beleeued, that hee might get great good by the earneſt prayers of others, and therefore doth deſire them,<note place="margin">Great things may be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pray toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> euen to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by the power of them from many great dangers. And it may bee (if wee haue marked the experience of our ſelues, and others) that we may well remember, what great deliuerances haue been graunted, when others haue laboured in prayers for vs, or wee for them: if not, wee may ſee it by the grace of God in time to come. But very few account prayer ſuch a labour or ſtriuing as it is, and ſo go to it coldly, and truſt to their own ſtrength, and ſo obtaine nothing. <hi>Pauls</hi> hope was in this, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould ſtriue with him in prayer; ſo we might haue greater hope, if wee ſought for helpe at the prayers of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and did not truſt to our owne too much.</p>
               <p>If thus in all matters of moment we deſire the prayers of others according to our neede, it will come to paſſe,<note place="margin">What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort we may haue when we haue deſired the prayers of others.</note> that wee ſhould not want the fruite of them, ſeeing the Lord hath promiſed to heare them; but howſoeuer things fall out with vs, we ſhal haue this comfort of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that we haue neglected no means, that God hath appointed for our good. But if wee bee careleſſe of the prayers of others, and ſo doe not ſeeke for them, beſides that it may come to paſſe that wee ſhall faile of our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe through our owne default: (as when one ſtriueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, he cannot ouercome, becauſe he hath none to ioyne with him; or at leaſt hee ſhall not obtaine it ſo ſoone, as otherwiſe hee might, as when one is about a thing alone, hee is the longer a doing it) we ſhall haue the leſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, or more griefe, becauſe we neglected ſome meanes that might haue done vs good. We muſt then be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the prayers of others may doe vs good, and that wee neede them, and ſo accordingly deſire them. In the daies of ignorance and ſuperſtition men gaue much to haue a continuall Maſſe for them, that is,<note place="margin">In Poperie they maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned others to pray for them.</note> to pray for their ſoules: and there were Beadmen alſo (as they called them) appointed for that purpoſe, to pray for the liuing and for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7191:12"/> the dead, and were maintained by the goods of the Church to that end: which prayers of theirs becauſe they were in an vnknowne tongue, and ſo without vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; and alſo not according to the word of God, and ſo without faith; could doe them no good: yet this truth they aimed at though in darknes and as blind men, that the prayers of others were ſo auaileable for them, that euen in that reſpect onely they gaue much yeerely vnto thoſe that ſhould pray for them. And truly if they had prayed aright, they might by their prayers haue giuen more than they receiued; for they might haue obtained great things of the Lord for them. But here was another great abuſe of that time in theſe prayers alſo, that they hauing others thus to pray for them, they reſted in that, and ſo neglected their owne prayers the more; and thought that they might doe it with the leſſe danger, for they had others that prayed for them continually, and ſo that that was wanting in themſelues, was ſupplied by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Dauid</hi> was of another minde, for heere by his prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe we haue an example of one, that ſo deſireth the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of others, as that hee purpoſeth not to neglect prayer himſelfe, or to vſe it any whit the leſſe for that; but to vſe it rather the more, willing them to pray God to heare his prayers: ſo that if he did not pray himſelfe, their prayers ſhould do him no good; but it ſhould be al one with him, as if one ſhould deſire a man to ſet his hand to a blank, and ſo he ſhould preferre that as a ſupplication for him to the Prince. So we are to deſire others to pray for vs, but in the meane ſeaſon we muſt not neglect to pray for our ſelues.</p>

Parents are bound to pray for their children, and they ſhould know it well enough; yea their children kneele downe and aske them bleſſing, and put them in minde of it, and notwithſtanding al this many doe forget it; and though they caſt out certaine words of courſe, yet they doe not thereupon determine ſeriouſly to pray for them: what would they doe then, if their children by asking them their daily bleſſing ſhould not put them in minde of it at all? Therefore euery man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of way we ſee, what great reaſon there is of this, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire others to pray for vs: and ſo much for this preſent.</p>

Then if the vngodly and prophane men of the world, who are not at all acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with prayer, yet haue thought that the prayers of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> might doe them good; then they that know what prayer doth meane, and that haue accuſtomed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to prayer, and haue obſerued the fruite of it in themſelues, may bee aſſured, that the prayers of others ſhall be of like or a great deale more force for them. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If they whoſe conſciences tels them, that for their vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe they are altogether out of Gods fauour, and ſo they had no heart to pray to him themſelues, neither had any hope that hee would heare them; yet haue had ſome hope, that God might heare ſome others for them, and ſo haue ſought vnto them for their prayers: then how much more they, who liuing in a good courſe, haue hope that God is wel pleaſed with them in Chriſt, may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that God will moſt willingly heare others for them, and ſo in great faith deſire their prayers? And to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> conclude, if they that are not of the Church of God, but are aliants and ſtrangers from it, haue been of opinion, that if any of the faithfull ſeruants of God in his Church would pray for them, that God would be mercifull vnto them for their ſakes: then how much more they that are the true members of the Church of God may verely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7191:14"/> that God will heare their fellow brethren for them? For as in a familie if ſtrangers can hope, that if ſome ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of ſpeciall account doe ſpeake to the maſter for them, hee will doe ſome thing at their requeſt; then they that are of the ſame houſe may bee aſſured much more that the intreatie of their fellow ſeruants ſhall doe them much good: So in the houſe of God,<note place="margin">

               <p>And this is that that we reade of in the perſon of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> King of Egypt,<note place="margin">Pharaoh often deſired Moſes and Aaron to pray for him.</note> who though he could not abide <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> yet when the hand of God was heauie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, hee was many times compelled to ſeeke to them for their prayers; and his owne conſcience did tell him, that the Lord might happely heare them for him, though himſelfe was vnworthie once to bee regarded of him. As when himſelfe and his land was puniſhed with frogs, hee called for them, and ſaid, <hi>Pray yee vnto the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>that hee may take away the frogges from me, and from my people:</hi> and afterwards, when they were puniſhed with great ſwarmes of flyes, ſo that the earth was corrupt with them: he ſaid, <hi>I will let you goe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>that yee may ſacrifice vnto the Lord your God in the wilderneſſe, but goe not farre away, pray for me:</hi> and thirdly, when the Lord ſent thunder, and haile, and lightning, ſo that the fire was mingled with the haile, he ſent, and called for them, and ſaid vnto them;<note place="margin">Chap. 9.27.</note>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7191:15"/> and all his people to bee wicked, and to haue deſerued theſe plagues, but he prayeth theſe his ſeruants to pray to God for them, and they doe ſo; and at their prayers the Lord remoueth theſe ſeuerall plagues. Thus this wicked man when he was in the middeſt of his deſerued puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and had no heart in them to goe to God himſelfe, yet ſought to others that he was well perſwaded of, and receiued great good often by their prayers.</p>

                  <hi>I beſeech thee pray vnto the Lord thy God, and make interceſſion for me, that mine hand may be restored vnto me.

                     <hi>Jerem.</hi> 37.3.</note> becauſe the Chaldeans did beſiege the citie, hee ſent certaine men vnto him, ſaying, <hi>Pray now vnto the Lord our God for vs.</hi> Behold how the moſt vngodly are driuen to iuſtifie this holie ordinance of prayer, in ſuch wiſe that they are compelled to ſeeke to thoſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for their prayers, whom otherwiſe they doe not loue, neither haue any good opinion of, but rather hate
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7191:15"/> them, and account them their enemies. Euen as thoſe in our time, who though they neuer cared for the miniſterie of the word, nor for the aſſemblies of Gods people, nor for his ſeruants, yet when they are in any great miſerie or feare, and lie at the point of death, are inforced to ſend to them, whom they neuer cared for in their life, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate them to pray for them, whom they would neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate for any thing before.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> the Sorcerer heard <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle iuſtlie denounce the fearefull iudgement of God againſt him for his ſinne; he fearing it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 8.24.</note> deſired <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to pray for him; ſaying, <hi>Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of theſe things, which ye haue ſpoken may come vpon me.</hi> This wicked man, who of a long time had bewitched the Samaritanes with his ſorceries,<note place="margin">And Simon Magus of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> ſaying that himſelfe was ſome great man, hoped that al that euill, which his ſinnes had deſerued, and which God had threatned againſt him, might by the prayers of his ſeruants be turned from him, and ſo hee eſcape them. Shall not wee then much more, who haue a deſire to pleaſe God, and to walke in his waies, hope that the prayers of others ſhall be auaileable, to turne from vs al thoſe euils, which our own conſciences tell vs we haue iuſt cauſe to feare, if wee ſeeke vnto them for them? Let vs then in the feare of God, and as we loue our owne wealth, determine to practiſe this Chriſtian du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie much more than we haue done: and let vs be heartely ſorie that for want of it we haue neglected our own good too much.<note place="margin">What good we might haue gotten if we had ſought to others for their prayers.</note> For many great things might wee haue obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, many fearefull troubles might wee ſoone haue been deliuered out of: yea ſome grieuous things, that haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen vs, might haue bin by the grace of God wiſely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, if we had ſought vnto others, who might haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the Lord for vs. In which reſpect wee haue great cauſe to be ſorie,<note place="margin">The great loſſe when the good die, whoſe prayers we had.</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord taketh away any good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or woman, for then we want ſo many that might ſtil haue prayed for vs, and for the Church, and ſo wee are left the more deſtitute of helpe. And if wee ought to lament the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7191:16"/> death of thoſe, who haue been beneficial to vs for world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, whoſe helpe wee ſee now that wee want to our great hindrance; then eſpecially ſhould wee be grieued, that wee are depriued of the comfortable preſence of thoſe, to whom in all diſtreſſes of bodie or minde, wee might reſort, and communicate our whole eſtate, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did to <hi>Ionathan,</hi> and might boldly haue deſired their prayers, and might with great facilitie haue obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them for vs.</p>
               <p>Thus much for this part of the title, that this Pſalme being a prayer of the Church for <hi>Dauid,</hi> hee made it for them, and committed it to the ſinger, that he might take order, that it ſhould be vſed publikly, and ſo by vertue of it did require, that thus they ſhould pray for him. One thing more of <hi>Dauid</hi> is to bee obſerued out of the title, and the diſcourſe of the whole Pſalme, namely with what minde and purpoſe, or to what end he deſired their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Not as purpoſing to neglect prayer himſelfe,<note place="margin">Dauid in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring their prayers did not purpoſe to neglect prayer himſelf.</note> or to grow any whit more ſlacke in it becauſe of that, and ſo to put off this as a burden from himſelfe, as one that had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great matters in hand, and ſo to commit it to them, that ſhould haue leiſure enough: As if hee ſhould haue ſaid, you know that I muſt goe out to battell againſt the Ammonites, and in warre wee ſhall haue our hands full, and our mindes taken vp euery way, I ſhall haue no leiſure to pray to God there, though I know it to be neceſſarie, and would faine doe it; I would haue you therefore to pray for me; and ſo truſting to them ſhould neglect this dutie himſelfe, and ſo they might haue prayed very doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly for him: but that they might be the more willing to pray for him in this caſe, hee telleth them, and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it openly, that he would pray to God himſelfe: and as he ſhould be in any ſpeciall trouble, ſo he would doe it much more earneſtly: and therefore he would haue them pray to God for him, that he would heare thoſe prayers of his.</p>
               <p>So then in requiring this of them, hee did not leaue
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7191:16"/> them in ſuſpenſe, to thinke thus, he willeth vs to pray for him indeede, and ſo it is our bound dutie to doe, and wee will doe it; but wee cannot tell whether hee will vſe any prayer himſelfe, which if hee doe not, ours ſhall doe him the leſſe good. But as hee required their prayers, ſo hee bound himſelfe to the like practiſe,<note place="margin">No more muſt kings when their ſubiects doe pray for them.</note> and would haue them alſo to know it before hand, that ſo they might pray ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, that God would heare his prayers. So that firſt of all Kings and Princes be they neuer ſo great, muſt not ſo require their ſubiects to pray for them, that they ſhuld thinke it were not needfull for themſelues to pray at all, for they had enow that daily did it for them euery where. And all others that deſire the prayers of their brethren, muſt not for that bee any one whit the more remiſſe and ſparing in their owne prayers: which is diligently to bee marked of vs, becauſe it is contrarie to the common prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Church of Rome, and of diuers others. For the Romiſh Synagogue maketh Emperours, Kings,<note place="margin">The practiſe of the Papiſts is otherwiſe.</note> and great men to beleeue vpon their credit, that prayer doth not ſo neceſſarily belong vnto them, or to ſuch kind of men; that doth peculiarly belong to the Clergie, and Church-men, (as they cal them); they could pray enough for them, and for al the world, if they may be wel paid for their labours. Therefore if ſuch men as they will but giue ſome lands and reuenewes to an Abbey, or erect a Monaſtery, or ſome religious houſe, there to be prayed for, they ſhall haue ſo many continually to pray for them, that it maketh no matter though themſelues very ſeldome or not at al pray. This kingly prophet, or propheticall king was of another minde, and ſo ought all godly and religious not onely Princes, but men and women to be.</p>
               <p>But to leaue theſe men,<note place="margin">And of ſome Goſpellers.</note> and their religious practiſes to themſelues, we ſhall finde this corruption to be in ſome, that are not of the worſer ſort; that when they know that others doe pray for them in ſickneſſe, or otherwiſe, they can be contented to let paſſe their owne prayers now and then in hope of that, and to become ſomewhat remiſſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7191:17"/> themſelues. But as <hi>Dauids</hi> deſire was here, not onely that they would pray for him, but after this manner, euen that God would heare his prayers, which hee had and would make euery day: ſo doth the Apoſtle ioyne theſe two ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fitly together, and requireth them both of all men alike:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13.14.</note> ſaying, <hi>Is any man among you afflicted? Let him pray: Is any ſicke among you? Let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray for him:</hi> where he would haue al men to pray for themſelues in their ſeuerall afflictions, and to ſend for others, that they might pray for them likewiſe.<note place="margin">We muſt not ſeuer our own prayers from the prayers of others.</note> And as he would not haue them in ſome caſes to content themſelues with their owne prayers, but ſend for others to pray with them; ſo hee would not haue them paſſe ouer their owne prayers in hope of that, but begin with them firſt, and pray themſelues, and if they cannot that way preuaile ſufficiently, then to call for the aide of others; among whom it may come to paſſe, that the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſome one righteous man or other might bee ſo fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, that it might auaile much for them. Therefore thoſe things which the Lord by precept, and by the practiſe of his ſeruants, hath ioyned together ſo neerely, let no man put aſunder.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Yet God hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants for thoſe that neither doe, nor can pray for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</note>And yet we doe not denie, but that ſuch is the goodnes of God to all ſorts of men, to leaue them without excuſe; and that hee hath made ſo many gracious promiſes vnto the prayers of his ſeruants, that hee often heareth them praying for thoſe, who neither pray for themſelues at all, neither can pray, nor haue any purpoſe to doe it. So did he diuers times, as hath been declared before, heare <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> praying for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of Egypt, &amp; for his Princes, and for his people: all which had no purpoſe at all to ſerue God themſelues, neither knew how to doe it, but did hinder, as much as lay in them, his people from it: and as for prayer, they know not how to pray one word aright. So did hee alſo heare the man of God, that prayed for <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the idolatrous king of Iſrael, when his hand was dried vp, as we haue ſeene euen now; ſo that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7191:17"/> both theſe were deliuered from their ſeueral plagues that were vpon them by the prayers of others, when they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew how to pray themſelues, neither had any deſire to learne. The like may be ſaid of the prayers of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> which hee in great compaſſion made for the filthie wicked Sodomites,<note place="margin">

And the Apoſtle exhorteth men in their ſickneſſe to ſend for the Elders of the Church to pray for them; and that both the one and the other might doe it in faith (the one ſend for them, and the other be willing to come) he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a gracious promiſe in the name of the Lord vnto their prayers, and ſaith that they ſhall thus obtaine for the ſicke both health of body, and forgiueneſſe of ſinne. <hi>Is any ſicke among you?</hi>

As for example, if in the loue and loyalty we owe to our ſoueraigne King, hearing of the treaſonable practiſes malitiouſly intended againſt his royall perſon, and noble progeny, we would be willing to doe him the beſt ſeruice for his defence that we could, what ſhall we doe?

As how wee haue prayed heretofore for the life and preſeruation of our gouernours, and namely of our late Soueraigne Ladie of famous memorie Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> and how God hath often deliuered her from many great treaſons intended againſt her by the Ieſuites and other Papiſts: how we haue prayed for others, as for the life, health, and proſperitie of our parents, husbands, wiues, children, neighbours, and friends, in their ſeuerall griefes of minde and infirmities of bodie, and other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, and what hath followed thereupon, as how they haue been recouered, and comforted, and otherwiſe hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and relieued: how here in the Church we haue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prayed for thoſe that haue been very ſicke euen at deaths doore, who haue receiued the ſentence of death in themſelues, and yet they haue recouered, and ſome of them are aliue ſtill; that ſo as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid vpon his former triall, <hi>The Lord that deliuered me out of the paw of the lion,</hi>

                  <hi>and out of the paw of the beare, hee will deliuer me out of the hand of this Philiſtim:</hi> ſo wee might vpon our former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience boldly ſay, God that of his mercie and goodnes hath vouchſafed to heare me for ſuch and ſuch, wil heare me alſo at this time for theſe. To this end alſo wee muſt wiſely obſerue and diligently marke for our owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and the good of others, what hath followed vpon
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7191:24"/> our prayers, and what God hath wrought or done for them. Yea all they that deſire the prayers of others for any ſpeciall cauſe, whether of the Church generally, or of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men particularly, ſhould ſignifie vnto them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards (which few or none doe, and it is a great vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes in them vnto God and man not to doe it) what bleſsings they haue found vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> themſelues by ſuch pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; not onely that they might bee thankfull to God for them, as they prayed for them before; but that being confirmed by ſuch experience, they might the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and boldly pray for them, and for others at ſome other time, as there ſhall be neede: and for want of this they cannot doe it ſo cheerefully and ſo confidently as otherwiſe they might doe.</p>
               <p>To conclude the ſumme of all that hath been ſaid in one word:<note place="margin">How greatly men faile in neglecting to pray for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> we ſee what is here required of vs, euen that we bee mindfull to pray for others, and what good reaſon there is for it, both in reſpect of our owne comfort, and of their good; let vs examine our ſelues, to ſee whether wee haue been ſo carefull to performe this dutie vnto them, as we ſhould. How often haue wee, and doe we pray for the good eſtate of the Church of God in other countries, as in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Netherlands, Geneua,</hi> and ſuch like, that God would defend them from their enemies, and inlarge the kingdome of Chriſt among them? Nay, how often doe wee pray for the Church of God in this land, and in the kingdomes vnited? How often for the Kings Maieſtie, the right honourable Councellors, Iudges, and Magiſtrates, not onely of this land, but more ſpecially of our owne countrey? How often for our neighbours, yea particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and by name for them of our owne family, as for al our children and ſeruants? Yea let vs call into our minds how often wee haue prayed ſeriouſly and in good earneſt for thoſe that haue deſired our prayers, and haue as it were made a couenant of prayer with vs, by promiſing that they would pray for vs, if we would remember the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we haue carefully kept this promiſe and couenant or
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7191:24"/> no: and when we ſhall finde that wee haue greatly failed this way; let vs be ſorie that wee haue not done that good this way that we might, and that hath been looked for at our hands: and therefore that wee cannot haue that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the common bleſſings of God in church and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, and vpon priuate men, that others haue. And let vs determine for the time to come to be more mindful of others in our prayers, and let vs be ſo indeede; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all the Church of God, and of all thoſe that we haue made this promiſe vnto, and ſo haue bound our ſelues to it by a couenant in the Lord: that ſo the Lord may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo reward vs with the prayers of others, and with the fruit of the ſame in our greateſt neede; when wee ſhall haue carefully performed this dutie vnto them before. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially let vs remember to pray for the King, and for all our gouernours, as wee are bound thereunto both by the word of God, and the lawes of the realme; as if wee had made a certaine promiſe to them for it.</p>

               <p>And that we might doe it,<note place="margin">What great benefits we enioy vnder the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our King.</note> let vs remember how the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle telleth vs of the benefits that wee receiue by our Kings, and to what end their gouernment is appointed: namely not for themſelues, but for their ſubiects, that they by their meanes might liue peaceably, honeſtly, and godlily: which are three great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities and comforts of this life, and without which our life were not life. And firſt for peace, nothing is more to bee deſired than that: for if we had all that we haue and a great deale more, and yet were ſubiect to warres abroad, or forren inuaſions, or to robbers and theeues at home, it would doe vs little good: And yet this peace without godlineſſe is nothing worth, as if wee had not the meanes of our ſaluation, and might not thus come to the Church to ſerue God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his word, and to leade our liues thereafter. And if we had theſe, yet if there ſhould bee no honeſtie among men, nor any true dealing one with another, ſo that one man might not truſt another, but there were lying, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, oppreſſion, and ſuch like without controulment. Now all theſe benefits of peace, honeſtie, and godlineſſe we haue by the meanes of our King: eſpecially wee may looke for them vnder his gouernment.<note place="margin">1. As to liue peaceably.</note> For as for forren enemies and inuaſions, which in former times wee haue been in feare of, he is in league with all Chriſtian Princes round about him, ſo that we ſhall not need to feare them: and as for tumultuous and diſordred perſons at home, the lawes are ſtill in force to ſuppreſſe them, and it is like that new ſhal be made, if there be any cauſe: and though ſome doe breake out in hope of the Kings pardon, yet for the time preſent the lawes will take hold of them, and how farre his gracious pardon will extend they know not: we may be ſure, that all ſuch ſhall be exempted, who doe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7191:26"/> euill before hand in hope of it.<note place="margin">2. Godlily.</note> And we hope to liue god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily vnder him, for we doubt not but that the Goſpel ſhall be continued, and wee hope that the eſtate of it ſhall be bettered: and though the Papiſts ſeeke for a toleration of their ſuperſtition, and comfort themſelues with falſe promiſes that way, yet we hope that their eyes ſhall fall out with looking for it in vaine: for ſeeing that hee hath kept it out of <hi>Scotland</hi> all this while when he was of leſſer power; there is no likelihood that he ſhould now yeeld vnto them, when he is of greater power, and more able to keepe vnder the whole route of them. But the more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately that they ſeeke for it, the more earneſtly had we need to pray to God for the King to bee zealous againſt them.<note place="margin">3. Honeſtly.</note> Laſtly, we hope to liue honeſtly vnder him, for he ſeeketh alreadie the good of all his ſubiects, as appeareth by his proclamations, wherein he hath giuen all men that are any way oppreſſed, to complaine of their griefes, yea though it bee againſt them that are in authoritie, with good hope of finding reliefe: he hath alſo put downe the Monopolies, and ſuch like kinde of abuſes, becauſe they ſtood not with the common profit of his people: and this he hath done, though his Maieſtie was interreſſed in ſome of them, and ſome, vnder the colour and pretence of that, hoped ſtil to retaine them. Therefore when we haue and looke ſtill to enioy ſuch great benefits by his moſt gracious gouernment, what great cauſe haue wee to pray for him?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What cauſe we haue to pray for the life of our King.</note> And the greater that theſe benefits be, the more cauſe haue we to pray for his life, by whom next vnder God we looke to haue them continued.

For though by the grace of God he hath iſſue of his owne bodie lawfully begotten in holy Matrimony, who ſhal ſit in the throne of the kingdome after him; yet they are all yong: and it is no great bleſſing, but rather a puniſhment, to haue children raigne ouer vs,<note place="margin">

Therefore wee haue great cauſe to pray for the life of our King: and the rather for that wee ſee how his life hath been deſperatly ſought by diuers: as appeareth by the confeſſion of ſome who are in priſon, at the leaſt for ſuſpition of treaſon. Now if they begin thus malitiouſly and impudently ſo ſoone; what will they not dare to doe hereafter, if God and good lawes doe not ſuppreſſe them?

                  <hi>The Lord heare thee]</hi> Theſe are the words of the prayer of the people for <hi>Dauid</hi> their King: but as <hi>Ioab</hi> taught the woman of <hi>Tekoah</hi> what ſhe ſhould ſay to the King,<note place="margin">Chap. 14.19.</note> and did put thoſe words into her mouth, which ſhe ſpake before him: ſo <hi>Dauid</hi> made this prayer for them, and taught them what they ſhould ſay vnto God in his owne behalfe, and did as it were put theſe words into their mouthes, when they ſhould come before him. And ſo hee not onely as a King taught his ſubiects what dutie they did owe vnto him; but as a Prophet alſo ſpeaking by the inſpiration of the ſpirit of God,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21.</note> as other holy men that wrote the Scriptures, informeth the Church of God what duties they owe to him, and to their ſuperiours.<note place="margin">Dauid teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the people their dutie to himſelfe.</note> So that he doth not in teaching them this duty of prayer for him, ambitiouſly ſeeke himſelfe, and ſtand vpon his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue, to ſay, Oh I am your King, you ought to pray for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7191:29"/> me, and to doe ſo and ſo: but he knew it to bee his owne dutie to informe them that were committed vnto his charge in all duties to God and men, euen to himſelfe: and therefore doth thus diſcharge it; knowing alſo that in his owne ſafetie did conſiſt their welfare, and therefore in praying for him (which hee taught them to doe) they ſhould benefit themſelues.<note place="margin">So may and ought all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours do to their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours.</note> So that by his example it is lawfull for all publike perſons in the Church and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, to teach thoſe that are vnder them, what du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they ſhould doe to them, and to require them at their hands without all ſuſpition of ambition, vainglorie, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies ſeeking themſelues.

For in preſeruing the authoritie of the miniſtery of the word inuiolable in their conſciences, and in the conſciences of others, conſiſteth the peoples welfare. So that as this people was not to except againſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7191:29"/> this prayer, when it came to them from <hi>Dauid;</hi> for it came not by the way of intreatie as an indifferent thing, but by a princely iniunction, or propheticall inſtruction, and ſo as a neceſſarie dutie of theirs, and therefore they were to thinke that they were bound vnto it, and that hee did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily require it at their hands; and not to make excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt it, and to ſay; Behold how hee ſeeketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, hee hath giuen vs a forme of prayer, but it is all or moſt for himſelfe: So when the Miniſters of Gods word ſhall ſhew what duties the people owe to them, as they are Gods Miniſters, they muſt not ſcornfully reiect it, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; he hath taught vs indeede a good leſſon to day, but the greateſt part of it did concerne himſelfe; ſee how wel he can plead for himſelfe.

                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6.</note> that the Corinthians might learne by them not to ſwell one againſt another for any cauſe) teacheth the Churches and people of God to pray for him,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.10.</note> Therefore though many (that I ſay not my ſelfe) doe often wittingly and of purpoſe paſſe by ſuch doctrine ariſing neceſſarily from the words of their text: or doe teach it ſeldome and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſparingly, leaſt any ſhould ſtumble at this without a cauſe: yet when any ſuch thing is deliuered, wee ſee how it muſt be receiued, and practiſed.</p>
               <p>The like is to be ſaid of all gouernours in a family:<note place="margin">And gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to thoſe that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> the parents, father and mother, or the maſter and miſtris or dame, may and ought without any imputation from any, teach their ſonnes and daughters, their maide ſeruants and man ſeruants what is their dutie not onely and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to God, but to others, euen to themſelues: and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7191:30"/> theſe inferiors muſt paciently heare them, and not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at it, but willing to learne and doe them. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that they ſhould thus thinke of themſelues, that they are in place to teach them, and ſo they muſt receiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction at their mouthes; the gouernours alſo do know that in the performance of ſuch duties to them conſiſteth their good, and for the neglect of ſuch, God will puniſh them. When as then they ſhall heare them ſay, you ought to behaue your ſelues thus and thus to me, you ought ſo to ſpeake, euen reuerently; your behauiour to mee, and your obedience ought to bee ſo and ſo; they muſt not proudly and diſdainfully caſt it behinde their backes, but willingly imbrace it, and conſcionably practiſe it.</p>
               <p>Yea, one man, in godlineſſe, wiſdome, and chriſtian modeſty,<note place="margin">And one neighbour may thus teach another.</note> may tell others what duties they owe to them in reſpect of their callings, yeeres, and ſuch like, and ſay, you ought to behaue your ſelfe towards mee thus and thus; do you not knowe that I am your elder, your better, your neighbour, your kinſeman, &amp;c? without any ſuſpition of fooliſh ambition. For as if wee had an euill debter, wee might without ſuſpition of couetouſneſſe tell him that hee is in our debt, and that hee oweth vs ſo much, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire him to pay it: ſo other duties that any owe to vs, we may without ſurmiſe of ſelfe-loue require at their hands. Therefore in what calling ſoeuer we be (though indeede we ſhould alwaies and in all things be more forwards to doe duties, then to require them of others: yet we ſhould not impoſe vpon our ſelues ſuch a maydenlineſſe, or Stoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal modeſtie, that we ſhould neuer challenge our right of men, and ſhew what duties they owe vnto vs: eſpecially, ſeeing wee ſhould teach and admoniſh one another whileſt we haue time, and whileſt it is called to day: and we alſo doe know,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13.</note> that for them to performe ſuch duties vnto vs, ſhall make for their good.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How hardly men will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this kind of teaching.</note> And this that we haue ſpoken, is the rather to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of vs, becauſe we ſhall find naturally that we do more eaſily admit that kind of teaching, wherein we are ſhewed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7191:30"/> our dutie to others, rather than to thoſe that doe teach vs. As if the Miniſter of the Goſpell ſhould publikely, or any other priuatly tell vs, what we ſhould doe to God, or to our King, or to our gouernors, or to our parents, or to our neighbours, we may happely with quietnes heare it (yet it were to be wiſhed that all would do ſo:) but if he come to ſhew what God requireth to be done to himſelfe, and to his miniſtery, then they are ready to take exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and they thinke that they may lawfully gaineſay it, at leaſt wiſe pauſe vpon it, and ſay, ſee what a faire taile he hath told for himſelfe: and ſo though it be a dutie, and God requires it of them, and they heare it, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience doth ſufficiently conuict them of it, yet forſooth, becauſe it concerneth them that ſpeake, they little regard it: and though in ſome caſes they will giue a man leaue to ſpeake for his owne profit, yet not for duties to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed vnto them, though it be for the profit of others. Therefore ſeeing that wee ſhall finde this corruption ſo ſtrong in vs, and ſo deepely as it were to be rooted in the bones, that it will not out of the fleſh; euen that our ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes will ſooner riſe againſt a man when he ſpeaketh to vs of himſelfe, and of our duty to him, then of another, and wee can more hardly brooke and digeſt ſuch kinde of teaching; we had need to be put in minde of it, and to be made acquainted with it ſo much the more.</p>
               <p>And thus we conclude by the example of <hi>Dauid</hi> in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this forme of prayer in his behalfe,<note place="margin">The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> and of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in vſing it for him (and ſo doe willingly performe this dutie of prayer for their King, though he taught it them) that it is lawfull for the Miniſters of God, to teach pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely in their Sermons ſuch duties as belong to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: yea and for all ſorts of men priuatly to admoniſh their neighbours and brethren of the like, without any iuſt ſuſpition of ill meaning: and that all inferiours muſt with meekenes and reuerence receiue ſuch inſtructions willingly at their mouthes; and be ſwift to heare them, and ſlowe to replie or ſpeake againſt them; and be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

So this our Lord and King, <hi>Iames,</hi> who is in a right line deſcended from her progenitors as heyre apparant to the crowne; and ſince his firſt entring into this land hath ſought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme many abuſes, and to doe much good, euen to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Goſpell, and to keepe out Popery; ſee how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny troubles in this ſhort time he is fallen into: beſides all thoſe which in his former kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> hee ſuffered.</p>

               <p>The ſecond thing ariſeth from theſe words, <hi>The Lord heare thee:</hi> In which, as hee confeſſed before,<note place="margin">Dauid prayed to God in his trouble.</note> that he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for troubles: ſo in theſe he ſheweth what hee would then doe, namely, flee to God for ſuccour, pray to him, and call vpon his name, that he might heare him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him. He would vſe all good meanes fit for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but he would not neglect this, knowing that all they were nothing without this; for they muſt haue their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and bleſſing from God by prayer. For he knew that though he had men, and horſes, and munition fit for war; yet as he ſaith in another Pſalme, <hi>I truſt not in my bow,</hi>

                  <hi>Pray continually:</hi> and in another place, <hi>Pray alwaies with all manner prayer and ſupplication in the ſpirit,</hi>

                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.29. The time of trouble is the ſpeciall time of prayer.</note> ſo all men, the more euident and dangerous their trouble is, the more earneſtly ſhould they pray vnto God for helpe. For the leſſe able that they are to helpe themſelues, or others to doe any thing for them, the more ſhould they ſeeke for help from God, who is able ſufficiently to affoord it. And truly many times God doth of purpoſe bring vs into trouble, that wee might call vpon him, and ſo hee might heare vs in the day of our trouble. So that no trouble ſhould ſo diſmay vs, that it ſhould hinder vs from prayer, but rather quicken vs vp vnto it, and to a greater feruency
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7191:34"/> in it.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.1.</note> For when the Church ſaith, <hi>Why hideſt thou thy ſelfe, O Lord, in due time, euen in affliction?</hi> it ſheweth, that as that is the fitteſt time for the Lord to heare and helpe vs, ſo for vs to pray vnto him, and to ſeeke for helpe at his hands. Therefore let vs not onely not thinke, that trouble doth exempt vs from prayer, or that it is ſo great that we cannot pray, and if wee were out of it, and ſo might haue our mindes quiet, we would pray: as that we beleeue ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that God at no time looketh for ſo much prayer at our hands, as when hee laieth affliction and trouble vpon vs.<note place="margin">Both publike and priuate.</note> So that if our troubles bee priuate, wee muſt often and earneſtly pray priuately: and if they be publike, wee muſt haue publike prayer thereafter: that ſo God may heare vs euery way in the day of our troubles; which he cannot doe, vnleſſe we then call vpon him. Now at this day there are many troubles in our land: as not onely ſecret practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of traytors againſt the Kings excellent Maieſtie, but alſo great ſickneſſe and mortalitie in many chiefe places, and the ſame dialy ſpreading it ſelfe further and further by reaſon of the great and dangerous contagion of the peſtilence:<note place="margin">As at this time eſpecially.</note> therefore it is high time for euery one of vs in all places to pray earneſtly vnto God; and as euery day bringeth vnto our eares the reports of new troubles, ſo muſt we continue in our prayers: that God may heare vs at the laſt, as he hath alſo promiſed that he will.</p>
               <p>The third thing to bee obſerued out of theſe words, is the forme and tenour of their prayer, which is this, that they pray to God, that he would heare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prayers of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> which hee ſhould make in the time of his troubles. Therfore as it is our duty to ſeek to others in our troubles for their prayers, and the greater that they be, to ſeek vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them for it the more, that they ſtriuing with vs in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, wee might obtaine: So when any ſhall thus deſire vs to pray for them, it is our dutie to doe it: and ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to deſire the prayers of others, that in no caſe we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect them our ſelues. (of which points ſeuerally wee haue intreated at large before) So more particularly wee ſee
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7191:34"/> from hence, how wee may pray for any,<note place="margin">We may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies thus pray for men that God would heare their prayers.</note> whether wee are deſired, or not deſired thereunto; whether we know their eſtate perfectly, or we be altogether ignorant of it; euen that God would heare them, and giue them according to their owne prayers. For as if one man ſhould haue a ſuite to another, and ſhould deſire vs to ſpeake for them, or wee know of it otherwiſe, though not in particular, what the ſpeciall thing is that hee deſireth; wee might ſay, I pray you bee good to ſuch a man, graunt him his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; wee might that wayes doe him ſome good: So this way wee may benefit men alo,<note place="margin">Though we know not their eſtate.</note> when wee pray to God to giue them their requeſts, though wee know not euery thing that they deſire. And thus did <hi>Hely</hi> the Prieſt pray for <hi>Hannah</hi> the wife of <hi>Elkanah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.13.</note> that God would heare her prayer that ſhe made, though hee knew them not; for ſhe ſpake in her heart onely, her lips did mooue onely, but her voyce was not heard: and when hee did miſtake her as though ſhee had been drunken,<note place="margin">As Hely did for Hannah.</note> ſhee ſaid nay, but ſhee was troubled in ſpirit, and did powre out her ſoule before the Lord; but did not tell him for what: Then he ſaid, <hi>Goe in peace, and the God of Iſrael grant thy petition, that thou haſt asked of him.</hi> And ſhe deſireth him ſtill that hee would pray for her. And at the laſt, when ſhe had obtained her requeſt, ſhe returned to giue thanks, and told him the whole matter, and ſaid, <hi>Oh my Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>as thy ſoule liueth my Lord, I am the woman that ſtood with thee here praying vnto the Lord: I prayed for this child</hi> (which ſhe had brought with her) <hi>and the Lord hath giuen me my deſire, which I asked of him: therefore alſo I haue giuen him vnto the Lord: as long as he liueth he ſhall be giuen vnto the Lord: and he worſhipped the Lord there.</hi> Where we ſee how he praied to God for her, that he would heare her praiers, and graunt her the petition that ſhe had asked of him, though he knew not what it was: and ſo requeſted him to continue his prayer ſtill for her, though ſhe doth not tell him the ſpeciall thing that ſhe prayed for.</p>
               <p>Indeede if wee knew the particular eſtate of men, wee
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7191:35"/> might pray for them more directly and more effectually:<note place="margin">But if wee know it we may pray for them more particularly. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16.</note> according to that counſell which S. <hi>Iames</hi> giueth vnto all; <hi>Acknowledge your faults one to another, and pray one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ye may be healed: for the prayer of a righteous man auaileth much, if it be feruent.</hi> Where he willeth vs not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make knowne the diſeaſes of our bodies to others, by ſending for them in the time of our ſicknes, but euen our ſpeciall ſinnes, that haue been the cauſe of them, that ſo in great compaſſion towards vs both of ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, they might pray feruently for vs, when they ſhall ſee what great neede euery way we haue of their prayers. But if we doe not thus confeſſe vnto them, or cannot, yet ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally and effectually alſo wee may pray God to heare their owne prayers, which they do and ſhould make prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally themſelues, according to the commandement of the ſame Apoſtle:<note place="margin">Verſ. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Is any among you afflicted? let him pray:</hi> that God, I ſay, would heare them in that trouble, that they bee in, what and whenſoeuer. Therefore no man in neglecting of this dutie of prayer for others, is to ſay, I would gladly pray for ſuch an one, if I knew his eſtate, and what to pray for: for it is ſufficient that the Lord knoweth it,<note place="margin">Ye are we not to neglect this dutie of praier for any, though wee know not their eſtate.</note> &amp; that he knoweth it himſelfe, and doth pray for himſelfe accordingly, then may wee ſafely pray, that God would heare thoſe prayers of his.

                  <hi>The name of the God of Iacob defend thee.</hi> In theſe words the people continue their prayers for the King, and therein come to this particular, that God would defend him: For by <hi>the name of God</hi> they meane God himſelfe, who hath by his name made himſelf knowne vnto vs: and by <hi>Iacob</hi> they meane either that particular perſon and holy Patriarke, to whom God had ſaid that he would be his God, and ſo had renued the couenant with him, that was firſt made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> his father and grandfather, and vpon whom he had beſtowed many great benefits and deliuerances: or by <hi>Iacob</hi> he meaneth the poſteritie of <hi>Iacob,</hi> that is, the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, with whom alſo as with their ſeede hee had coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted to be their God, and that they ſhould be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to whom he had made himſelfe knowne to be ſo by his word, Sacraments, and works, and vpon whom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he had beſtowed many great deliuerances in Egypt, in the red ſea, in the wilderneſſe, and in their owne land: or by it, hee meaneth them both. And ſo they pray, that hee that was the God of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and ſo their God, and had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen himſelfe that name, and by it had ſhewed how good and gracious he was, and would ſtill be vnto them, would defend him from his enemies by his mightie power, and great goodneſſe. So then as they had before generally prayed God to heare his prayers, whatſoeuer they ſhould be: ſo here particularly, becauſe he was in trouble,<note place="margin">The doctrine of the ſame.</note> or like to come vnto it, they pray for Gods defence in it, that hee might not miſcarrie, but happily come out of the ſame, and haue a bleſſed iſſue therein.

And therefore as a childe asketh not onely things needfull of his father, but this and that; and as Chriſt ſaith (but to another end) hee asketh him an egge, or fiſh, or bread; ſo we muſt doe vnto the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">And ſowe muſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of others vnto God.</note> And as wee muſt thus pray for our ſelues, ſo for others alſo: God would haue vs to take knowledge of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, as much as we can, and be touched with it; that we might pray for this and that according to their neede in ſoule and bodie. Thus muſt wee pray by this example for our King, not onely that God would heare his prayers from time to time; but ſeeing that wee heare that hee is ſubiect to many daungers, and that his enemies doe hunt after his life, and beſides the common caſualties of all men that he is with them ſubiect vnto, his life is ſpecially ſought for: therefore we muſt pray that God would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, in theſe attempts, by diſcouering them in time, and bringing them to naught, yea conuerting or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding all his enemies. And this is the beſt vſe that wee can and ſhould make of all the newes that wee heare of treaſons breaking foorth; that wee ſeeing the daungers, might pray to God to defend him. And as wee muſt doe thus for his Maieſtie firſt and chiefly, ſo for any others:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7191:37"/> as when wee heare in what danger the Churches are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſeas, as <hi>Geneua</hi> and others, how they are aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their enemies, let vs pray to God to defend them. And ſo likewiſe for our brethren here at home. We heare how the peſtilence raigneth in many places, wee are not only to pray that God would heare them; but more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that God would defend them from it, that are not in it; and thoſe that are, that he would deliuer them out of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if it be his holy will. And thus as we muſt pray one for another, ſo wee ſee what wee ſhould pray for. So did the Martyrs one for another, that God would giue them comfort in the priſon, and ſtrength againſt the fire. And thus it is written of Doctor <hi>Cranmer</hi> Archbiſhop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, that when his fellow priſoners Doctor <hi>Ridley</hi> and Maſter <hi>Latimer</hi> were burnt at Oxford for the Goſpell, hee looking out of the priſon where hee was, cried, <hi>The Lord Ieſus ſtrengthen you.</hi> They had neede then of great patience and ſtrength to beare ſuch things, and ſo hee prayed to God to giue them that which then they moſt needed. So then if wee know any to be in any diſtreſſe of ſoule or bodie, wee muſt pray for them according to their ſeuerall neede: as if they bee tempted for ſinne, that God would comfort them with the forgiuenes of their ſinne: if they bee tempted vnto ſin, that God would ſtrengthen them againſt the ſame, and giue them the ſhield of faith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.16.</note> whereby they may quench all the firie darts of the diuell: if they be fallen into ſinne, that God would raiſe them vp, and giue them repentance: if they bee poore, and want meate, drink, or cloathing, that God would giue them all things neceſſary for this life: if they be in ſicknes, that God would giue them patience and health: if they be oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with enemies, that God would reuenge their cauſe: if they be in any loſſe, that God would recompence it vnto them. And ſo it is not enough to ſay, God be with them, God helpe them, or God bleſſe them, but we muſt come further to this or that, and pray God to giue it them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their neede, as here they pray for defence for
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7191:38"/> their King in this daunger that hee was in. And ſo wee ſee what wee haue to obſerue out of theſe words generally. The reſt wee will proſecute the next day by the grace of God.</p>

                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.29.</note> to the firſt borne of the captiue that was in priſon, and all the firſt borne of beaſts, ſo that there was no houſe, where there was not one dead: yet the houſes of the Iſraelites were marked with the blood of the Lambe, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7191:40"/> ſo none dyed there; and that was, becauſe that was a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that when the Angell ſhould ſee the blood, he might paſſe ouer them, and ſo the Lord did not ſuffer the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer to enter into their houſes, nor the plague to come vpon them to deſtruction: for if God had not kept him out according to his promiſe, they might haue dyed alſo.</p>
               <p>So then concerning all them that we wiſh well vnto (as wee ſhould doe to all our brethren) and for our ſelues,<note place="margin">Whether we haue meanes, or haue them not, all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence from the peſtilence is only from God.</note> wee ſee who muſt be ours and their onely defence: and who hath defended vs, and them hitherto: euen the Lord, from whom all things doe come both good and euill: therefore to him be thankfull, in him truſt, and to him ſtill pray. For what is the cauſe that this peſtilence is ſo greatly in one part of the land, and not in another? and in the ſame citie and towne, why is it in one part, or in one houſe, and not in another? and in the ſame houſe, why is it vpon one, and not vpon all the reſt, when they all liue together, and draw in the ſame breath, and eate and drinke together, and lodge in the ſame chamber, yea ſometimes in the ſame bed? what is the cauſe of this, but that it pleaſeth the Lord in wiſdom, for ſome cauſe to defend ſome for a time, and not the reſt? Therfore let vs beleeue, that in theſe dangerous times God muſt bee our onely defence, and the defence of all others. There are ordinary means, I grant, to bring the plague into a place, and meanes to keep it out by the bleſſing of God: but who giueth thoſe meanes, but God? and who bleſſeth them, and maketh them effectuall, but he? or who worketh without them, or aboue them, but onely he? Therefore let vs beleeue this, that all defence both in this ſickneſſe, and all other dangers for our ſelues, and for others, is only from God; and ſo in that faith let vs pray as theſe doe here, not only for our ſelues, but for others that are in danger of the plague, <hi>The name of the God of Iacob defend you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore when in any ſicknes or otherwiſe we haue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo good meanes, let vs not truſt to them,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.6.</note> but to the Lord, who onely killeth and reuiueth, bringeth downe to hell, and raiſeth vp againe. King <hi>Aſa</hi> (as wee haue heard)
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7191:41"/> truſted to the Phiſitions,<note place="margin">Therefore we muſt not truſt to the means: for God can fruſtrate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> and ſought vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his ſicknes, and ſo though he being a King had many about him, &amp; the moſt skilfull that could bee gotten, and all helpes that Art could affoord, yet he died. Wee ought then to vſe all good means in this time of the peſtilence; but not truſt to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but in the liuing God; for without him all Phiſitions &amp; al Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick ſhall doe vs no good. For God can for a time infatuate the wiſeſt Phyſitions, that they ſhall not diſcerne of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the diſeaſes; and to bee able to doe it alwaies is the ſpeciall gift of God: and when they haue found it out, yet at that time they ſhall not wiſely and according to art pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, but commit ſome great error; if they do al this well, it may come too late, when we are paſt helpe: if it come in time, we may diſlike it, and our heart goe againſt it: if wee be deſirous to take it, the things cannot be had, or not had in time conuenient: and when all is readie, wee ſhall be ſo weake, that we are not able to take them, if we do doe, they brooke not with vs, and we cannot beare them: if we doe, yet they haue loſt their force, and are not well compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and if they be, yet they ſhall not worke at all, or to any purpoſe; if they doe, yet not as they ſhould; and ſo they ſhall doe vs no good, though wiſely preſcribed, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully taken. Therefore as in the great famine that was in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, when a woman cried vnto him, ſaying, <hi>Helpe, my Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 6.27.</note>

So wee by all theſe, and the reſt of his names and titles giuen vnto him, know certainly what he is, and will be vnto vs, and what we are to look for from him. And from this knowledge of the name of God ariſeth confidence in prayer: as when they know him,<note place="margin">From hence ariſeth confi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dence in prayer.</note> and here call him the God of <hi>Iacob;</hi> that is, hee that hath made a couenant of mercie with him, and with his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie, that he will be their God, and they ſhall be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; they may be bold to flee to him for ſuccour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently call vpon him in the day of their trouble to heare them, and to helpe them, as they doe. And the more that they know of his name, that is, of his goodneſſe, mercie,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7191:43"/> truth, power, wiſedome, iuſtice, &amp;c: ſo may they the more boldly pray vnto him: not doubting, but that hee will be anſwerable to his name. For if a mortall man ſtand ſo vpon the credit of his name, that he will do many things, to thoſe that ſeeke him, to preſerue it: then God will much more ſhew himſelf to vs to be ſuch, as he hath manifeſted himſelf vnto vs by his name. And thus our Sauiour Chriſt to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage vs to call vpon God, hath in that forme of prayer, that he hath taught vs to vſe, ſet before it the name of God, and willeth vs to begin thus: <hi>O our Father which art in heauen:</hi> that we beleeuing him to be a father in affection to vs; and almightie, that is, to haue all power in his hand to help, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling not only in earth, but in heauen: we might be bold to pray vnto him, and to aske, not doubting but that of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly goodnes, &amp; infinit power he will heare vs, &amp; help vs.</p>
               <p>For as among men, according to the good name that they haue for liberalitie, and pitie,<note place="margin">As men that haue a good name are moſt ſought vnto.</note> ſo will men bee readie to come vnto them in their neede: and the poore will ſay, I will goe to ſuch an houſe, for they haue a good name, and are counted good to the poore, and mercifull, al men ſpeak well of them for their liberalitie: and this name of theirs gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> incouragement to come boldly &amp; often: So when wee know God thus by his name, it will make vs bold to come vnto him in prayer.

Or if a man be neuer ſo mercifull, and others know it not, and ſo they are ignorant of his good name, that hee hath, and that hee is worthie of, they cannot with any good hope come vnto him, for they know not what he is, they haue heard nothing of him at all. So when by vnbeleefe we hardly conceiue of God &amp; of his goodnes, or for wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of knowledge are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his good name, euen of al his mercie, &amp; of his truth,

Therefore as if wee had any dealing by the way of petition and ſupplication with a great man, wee would inquire after his name, and what report hee had in the countrie, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that wee would proceede or ſtay: So, that wee might come to God in our neede with confidence, (as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> and the people doe here) let vs inquire after his name, that is, let vs in the Scripture ſee, how he is called mercifull, yea the God of all mercie, and the father of all conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">

               <p>We ſee then with what minde <hi>Dauid</hi> goeth to the battell; he was a valiant man himſelf,<note place="margin">Though they had many helpes for warre, yet they looke for all their helpe from heauen. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.8.</note> as appeared in his combat with the great giant <hi>Goliah;</hi> hee had a great armie alſo, and all things meete for warre, and had gotten many great victories before, and ſo he knew by experience, what he and his companie were able to doe: and hee had many worthie Captaines, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploites and valour are highly commended in the Scripture: and yet they goe not on confidently and preſumptuouſly, thinking that they ſhould bee able to make their part good enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their enemies, for they were able to doe ſo and ſo: one of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7191:51"/> them had ſlaine eight hundreth at one time; another of them defended a place againſt the whole hoſte of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims, and another ſlew three hundreth at once: and three of them did breake through the armie of the Philiſtims to fetch water for <hi>Dauid,</hi> and returned ſafely, and ſuch like things they might haue boaſted of. But as though they were no bodie, nor euer had done any thing, or had no means to help themſelues, they pray, that God would ſend them helpe from heauen: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that all that they had, or that they could ſay for themſelues, was nothing without him, and his helpe. Contrarie to the common courſe of our time,<note place="margin">Contrary to the common courſe of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and ſouldiers.</note> in which men runne on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperatly to the warre, and neuer thinke of God, or of his helpe, eſpecially if they be any thing well prouided againſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: and ſo God forſaking them, whoſe aide they do not ſeek, they ſpeede thereafter. As <hi>Benhadad</hi> King of Aram boaſted of himſelfe and of his power, and thought that he might do what he liſt, and therefore caſted out blaſphemous threats, ſaying, <hi>The gods do ſo to me, &amp; more alſo, if the duſt of Samaria be enough for all the people that follow me,</hi>

And the want of this faith, and of prayer the fruite of it, as it hath brought great loſſe of men among other people, and made long warres, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo vpon the Engliſh men both in Ireland, &amp; in the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7191:51"/> and ſo wee ſee how theſe euils, by the grace of God may be preuented for the time to come. Now that that is ſaid here of this particular, as of warre, is true of all other troubles and dangers whatſoeuer, that our helpe in them muſt be from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and therefore we muſt by prayer ſeek for it at the hands of God (as theſe do here) if we will haue it: but firſt of al we muſt beleeue that it is ſo. And that wee might ſo doe, let vs conſider that that which <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith of this thing, is true of all other: <hi>The horſe is prepared againſt the day of battell,</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E heard the laſt day, that not onely in warre, but in all other troubles generally, all our helpe muſt be from God, and ſo we muſt ſeeke to him for it, as theſe doe here: And this is that faith that we muſt labour for in this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous time of the peſtilence, as in all other ſickneſſes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,<note place="margin">This faith wee ought to haue in this time of the peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> that it is God that muſt ſend helpe from heauen to our brethren, and to our ſelues: and that neither we nor they can haue any helpe at all, but from thence: and that there is helpe to bee had, when there is none in the earth, but all helpe, and all meanes of help faile here below. For though there be means to ſerue Gods prouidence for euery purpoſe, yet all they are of God, and the bleſsing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo. As now at this time, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates in the places infected, ſhould take good order that the ſicke be well looked vnto, and prouided for, and that there bee care had that they come not abroad, and that the whole may be kept from the ſicke, as by the law of God the leapers were put apart from the ſocietie of men, becauſe their diſeaſe was contagious, and when they came abroad they ſhould crie out alowd,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>I am vncleane, I am vncleane,</hi> that all men might auoide them. And there are meanes of phiſick for the preſeruation of thoſe from the contagion, that are neceſſarily to be imployed about the ſick, and that muſt come into dangerous places: yet theſe cannot be had nor vſed, vnleſſe God giue men this wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and when they haue them, as <hi>Dauid</hi> here had all good meanes for the warre, yet helpe and ſuccour commeth from God, as it ſhall pleaſe him to bleſſe the meanes. Thus true faith will make vs place our truſt and hope, where wee ſhould, and where it will not deceiue vs: and truly that is no ſmall thing in any danger,<note place="margin">And ſhew it by prayer for our ſelues and others.</note> nay it is all in all. For if wee truſt to theſe meanes, beſides that it may be that wee cannot haue them, if wee haue them they may doe vs no good, and ſo deceiue vs: but if wee truſt in God, and in his helpe, whether we haue meanes, or haue them not, that will be an anchor, that ſhall not confound vs; for we truſt in him, and in his defence, from whom onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7191:52"/> all help. Now if we ſay we haue this faith, it muſt appeare by the fruites; and namely, that if we haue all good meanes, as <hi>Dauid</hi> had here, we be not ſecure and truſt in them, but pray earneſtly vnto God, as though wee had them not; much more when we haue them not in deed. Prayer then is a ſpecial token in all things that we goe about, that we look for our help from God: and therefore if we beleeue that it is God that muſt ſtay this mortality and ſicknes, and that he muſt defend others and our ſelues in it, we muſt pray earneſtly and continually for our ſelues and them: but if we let prayer alone, or vſe it ſeldome, whatſoeuer we ſay with our mouth, we do not ſo beleeue it in hart as we ſhould. For faith muſt appeare by the fruits of it, els it is a dead faith, and as a body without a ſoule, which hath no actions of life: and prayer is one principall fruit, as the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>How ſhal they cal vpon him, in whom they haue not beleeued?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13.</note> ſhewing that as there can be no prayer without faith, ſo faith doth neceſſarily bring forth prayer. Therefore let vs ſtir vp our ſelues vnto prayer, and neuer ceaſe calling vpon God, euen as we do beleeue that all our helpe muſt come from him.</p>
               <p>And here by the way we ſee the nature of true faith,<note place="margin">Faith ſeeth helpe in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, when there is none in earth.</note> that it cauſeth vs to ſee help in heauen, &amp; ſo to pray for it, when there is none to be ſeene in the earth. And this is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween faith &amp; vnbeleefe: that the very vnbeleeuers can by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon conceiue of help, ſo long as they haue any meanes to help them; but if they fayle, they can ſee none at all: ſo they are like vnto thoſe that are pore-blind, who can ſee nothing but neere at hand. But faith ſeeth a farre off, euen into heauen, ſo that it is the euidence of things that are not ſeene:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1.</note> for it looketh vnto the power of God, who hath all meanes in his hand, or can worke without them, who made all of nothing, and calleth the things that bee not, as though they were. So that as the holy Martyr S. <hi>Stephen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.54.</note> when his enemies were ready to burſt for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and gnaſh at him with their teeth, looked ſtedfaſtly into heauen, and ſaw Chriſt ſtanding at the right hand of God rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to defend him: ſo faith in the promiſes of the word, doth ſee help in heauen ready for vs, when there are no meanes in earth. For as <hi>Abraham</hi> did not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider his own body,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.19.</note> nor the deadnes of <hi>Sarahs</hi> womb, but conſidered what God had promiſed, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7191:53"/> what he was able to doe: ſo if we look to the promiſes of Gods word, which are many and moſt true, wee ſhall ſee helpe from heauen, if no where elſe. Let vs labour then for that faith which may comfort vs from heauen, for it may be in the extremity of this ſickneſſe wee ſhall ſee none in earth: ſo when others are dumbe, or not knowing what to ſay, our mouthes ſhal be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſpeake vnto God, and ſay, Send vs helpe from the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, that is, from heauen.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Strength from Sion.</note> It thus followeth: <hi>And ſtrengthen thee out of Sion.</hi> Before they prayed for helpe from heauen, now they pray for ſtrength out of Sion: where by <hi>Sion</hi> they meane that part of Ieruſalem, called mount Sion, where afterwards the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple was built; where now the Arke (the viſible ſigne of Gods preſence was) where they worſhippe God in the word, ſacrifice, and prayer: and by <hi>ſtrength,</hi> thee meaneth not the ſtrength of men and munition meet for war &amp; for help, (which was prayed for before) but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtrength of the mind, &amp; courage which was meet for the enemy: that he might truſt in the defence of God, &amp; might not be diſmayed by any power of the aduerſary, but that he might beare his eſtate as was conuenient. And this was very requiſit; for if he had had neuer ſo many meanes,<note place="margin">Courage of mind is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</note> and had had no heart, he ſhould not haue vſed them, or vſed them to no purpoſe: and how ſhould he haue ſtrength of heart, vnles God gaue it? and how ſhould God giue it, vnles he asked it of him? Therefore he taught them to pray for that alſo. This ſheweth that as in war, ſo in all other afflictions which cauſe feare, there is requiſite an inward courage of the mind to vphold a man: for if he haue a good hart he ſhall beare many things: and if he haue no hart, the leaſt thing will diſmay him.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>If the Lord kill me, I will truſt in him.</hi> At this time eſpecially in reſpect of this great ſicknes it is moſt needful to haue ſtrength of faith, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue Gods gracious prouidence, that things come not by chance, but by his fatherly diſpoſition: and to beleeue that he hath a care of vs, and that nothing commeth by fortune; for if a Sparrow falleth not to the ground without his wil,<note place="margin">

I ſay, as this faith is alwaies requiſite, becauſe we know not what may befall vs on the ſuddain, ſo moſt of all at this dangerous time. And this is neceſſary not only for our ſelues, but for our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren alſo, that accoridng to the meaſure of the ſickneſſe and paine, and temptations of their minde, ſo they might haue ſtrength to beare al. For the very want of this ſtrength hath bin the cauſe, that many euen for feare haue been ouercome: much more when the thing hath bin vpon them, haue they fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great impatiency and many lamentable outcries. Euery one of vs is well acquainted with our owne weaknes this way, and do find by experience how ſmal things we can beare, and how the leaſt thing doth ouercome vs, yea, the very feare of it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times: therefore we had need to labour for ſtrength. And by that weakenes that is in our ſelues, we may eaſily iudge what is in others, and ſo ſee how requiſit it is for them alſo, that God ſhould ſtrengthen them.</p>
               <p>Further it is to be conſidered,<note place="margin">God onely ſtrengtheneth and weakneth the heart of man.</note> that as we haue ſeene how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite it is for vs to haue ſtrength according to the meaſure of our croſſes &amp; temptations: ſo of whom we ſhal haue it, namely of God, for they pray to him for it, and ſay, The Lord ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thee out of Sion: he hath the hearts of all in his hands, to order at his pleaſure; and if he giue ſtrength, then ſhall we be ſtrong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if he withdraw his hand from vs, and caſt feare vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, if we were as ſtout as Lions before, we ſhall be as weake as water. And this truly as it is a great puniſhment to bee too
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7191:54"/> feareful, ſo God hath threatned to caſt it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them that breake his law: and contrary to be of a good courage, as it is a ſingular fruit of a good conſcience, ſo God hath promiſed to giue it to thoſe that keepe his law.<note place="margin">

Thus we ſee who is the giuer of al ſtrength in al trials and temptations, and that we haue it not of our ſelues. Therefore no man muſt thus preſumptuouſly think of himſelf, that if trouble come he hopes he ſhal beare it out wel enough, for he hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſtrength and courage: for if he were of as great courage and valour as <hi>Dauid,</hi> who ſlew a Lyon and a Beare, yea <hi>Goliah</hi> himſelfe; yet when he commeth to a new trial, he ſhal find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe altogether inſufficient, but as the Lord ſhall make a new ſupply of ſtrength. The Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter</hi> thought himſelf to be a ſtouter man a great deale then he was, and that he would not ſhrinke for a little, when he ſaid: <hi>if all men forſake thee, yet will not I:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.33.</note> but at the length God leauing him to himſelf for his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, he had no ſtrength to ſtand, but did both deny &amp; forſweare his Maiſter three times. Thus wee muſt aſcribe all our former ſtrength vnto God, &amp; he only it is, that muſt ſtrengthen vs still.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">In troubles we muſt pray to God to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then vs. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.5.</note> Seeing it is ſo, we muſt pray to him for it, as <hi>Dauid</hi> doth here; prayer is the meanes to obtaine all things from God: therefore not only if we lack wiſedome, as the Apoſtle ſaith, let vs aske it
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7191:54" rendition="simple:additions"/> of God, but if we lack any thing els; as if we be faint-harted, if we be weake in faith, if wee lack patience, if wee feare that wee ſhall not be able to beare things. Therefore as in trouble wee muſt pray for other things according to our eſtate, as for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance, or mitigation; ſo eſpecially for ſtrength to beare what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhall be laid vpon vs: and wee may doe it in the greater faith, becauſe God hath promiſed it,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13.</note> euen that hee will lay no more vpon vs, than we ſhall be able to beare. So then in all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction let this be one part of our prayer; for if God ſtrengthen vs, we ſhall be able to beare any thing. And whereas they pray thus for <hi>Dauid,</hi> it is our bound duty ſo to pray one for another: as if we heare of any to be vnder any croſſe, pray vnto God for them, that God would ſtrengthen them.<note place="margin">And ſo ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then thoſe that are vnder the plague.</note> So did the Martyrs in perſecution one for another, and ſo muſt we do now for thoſe that are, or ſhalbe viſited with this peſtilence: that God would ſtrengthen them with faith in his good prouidence, with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to beare all things, with perſeuerance vnto the end. And as he looked for good by their prayers, ſo God that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded vs to pray one for another, will not ſuffer vs to pray for them in vaine. And thus though we cannot come one to an other by reaſon of the infection, to miniſter any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, yet wee may pray vnto God to ſtrengthen them; and though wee cannot eaſe them of their paine, yet God may ſtrengthen them by our prayers to beare it patiently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Out of Sion.</hi> As before he had taught them to aske ſtrength for him, ſo here he doth ſhew from whence he did looke for it,<note place="margin">Out of Sion, the place of Gods worſhip.</note> and from whence hee would haue them pray that it might come: namely from Sion, which was the place of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; vnto which hee had reſpect in naming the place, which there, and there onely, was to bee had: without which that place did not differ from any other. Whereas then theſe are the things that doe ſtrengthen vs in trouble, that we haue ſaith in the forgiuenes of our ſinnes, and in Gods prouidence, hope that God will be with vs, and defend vs, and lay no more vpon vs than we ſhall be able to beare, and patience that we may be quiet: All theſe are wrought and increaſed in vs by the word, Sacraments, and prayer; which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

Firſt then he ſheweth, that he beleeued, that all his confidence in trouble, and courage in danger, ſhould come from the meanes of Gods worſhip, and without the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhould be as faint-hearted, as might be: but by them hee might bee made confident and bold, to behaue himſelfe in the midſt of trouble,<note place="margin">Commeth all ſtrength of faith.</note> as he ſhould doe. And this is moſt true, and that which all of vs muſt beleeue, and ſhall finde to be true by experience, that into what trouble or danger ſo euer we ſhall come, we ſhal haue no more heart to beare any thing, than as we haue profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the word, and Sacraments, and prayer, to beleeue the promiſes that God hath made vnto vs in his word. For as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> confeſſeth of himſelfe, <hi>I had periſhed in my trouble, if my hope had not bin in thy word:</hi>

So that take away the word, and there can be no hope; &amp; without hope we haue no ſtrength to beare any thing, and ſo we muſt needes periſh in any trouble. And hereunto agreeth the Prophet, when he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.5.</note> 
                  <hi>My ſoule hath waited on the Lord, and I haue truſted in his word:</hi> he was in great trouble, and prayed vnto God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsing his ſinne, beleeuing the mercie of God, and ſo waiting vpon him for it: but how? truſting in the word: ſo al his hope was from that. And indeede what hope can we haue, but from it? For if God had promiſed vs nothing, or we knew it not, how could we haue any hope? and without hope there is nothing but impatiencie, and ſo no ſtrength to beare any thing. So that al our ſtrength is from the word, and in that reſpect from Sion, that is, the place, where it is publikely taught vs, that we might beleeue it, and ſo be ſtrengthened by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Few beleeue that all their ſtrength to beare things is from Gods word.</note> Thus though it be moſt true, yet few beleeue it, that when trouble comes, all their ſtrength to beare it, muſt come from the knowledge and faith which they haue gotten from the word: But without this they imagine that they ſhall beare things well enough; for they haue good hearts, and ſtout, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7191:55"/> are not fearfull, as they ſay, they will not be daunted for a little: they haue ſuch and ſuch meanes to truſt vnto, and they will be merrie, and haue good companie, and paſſe away things light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and they ſhal not come neere their hearts greatly to trouble them: and ſo they will beare them out well enough.

For though they may ſtoutly beare out things for a time, yet in the end they will fall into great impatiencie and deſpaire, or els into hardnes of heart and blockiſhnes, but as they ſhalbe ſtrengthened by the free promiſes of God made in his word.<note place="margin">

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7191:57" rendition="simple:additions"/> preached: and to that end, that the Lord would watch ouer, and preſerue his faithfull Miniſters, the preachers of his word, as the chiefe captaines that ſhould incourage &amp; ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the reſt: and that the people may reuerently eſteeme of the word, and of them for the words ſake, &amp; ſo be careful of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and of their liues. And that all would willingly come to the word, that may: and they that are ſicke, or ſhut vp and cannot, that God would forgive them their negligent hearing of his word in time paſt, whereby they might haue gotten more ſtrength: and that hee would bleſſe that that they heard here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, that by it they may be ſtrengthened, and by it be aſſured of the forgiuenes of their ſinnes, and may haue hope of eternal life, and ſo patiently abide whatſoeuer God ſhall lay vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and further to pray, that the ſeed of Gods word, that hath been ſowen in the furrowes of their harts, may now appeare in them to their owne comfort, and the incouragement of others, and all patience, and hope, and ioy of the holy Ghoſt: And alſo that they might be ſtirred vp to reade it diligently, and carefully to meditate vpon it, and haue wiſedome to applie it to themſelues, that ſo they may haue ſufficient ſtrength thereby. Thus ſhall it come to paſſe, that though wee cannot viſit them that are ſicke according to our deſire, for feare of the infection, to comfort them in preſence by the word of God in our mouthes; yet we may pray for them, that God would through the inward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his holy ſpirit, ſtrengthen them by that good word of his, which they haue heard before. That if it ſhall pleaſe God to take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of this world, that they may walke in the ſtrength of that ſpirituall foode, which they haue already receiued vnto the kingdome of heauen:<note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 19.8.</note> euen as <hi>Elijah</hi> the Prophet walked in the ſtrength of his corporall foode fortie daies and fortie nights vnto Horeb the mount of God.</p>
               <p>And though in ſpeaking of the ſtrength that is to be had in Sion, wee haue ſpecially ſtood vpon the ſtrength that wee haue from the word: yet we exclude not the Sacraments, &amp; prayer,<note place="margin">This ſtrength alſo is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and by prayer pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate.</note> but include them rather, as parts of Gods worſhip, and meanes alſo from whence wee muſt receiue ſtrength againſt trouble. For the Sacraments are as ſeales to confirme vs in the truth of Gods promiſes, and we muſt vſe them to that end: and by the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7191:58"/> prayers of the Church both the Word and the Sacraments are fruitfull, and of force to ſtrengthen vs: therefore whileſt wee may, wee muſt vſe them alſo, and make this account of them, that by them wee may get ſufficient ſtrength for all troubles that ſhall befall vs. And let vs know aſſuredly, that how much we haue or ſhall faile in the vſe of either of theſe, ſo much may we iuſtly faile of ſtrength: and the more we vſe them, the more ſhall we haue ſtrength, and be able to beare any thing. In this reſpect againe I beſeech you, that you would come diligently to the Church, that yee may bee partakers of common prayers there, that ſo by them alſo yee may be ſtrengthened. For God hath made a ſpeciall promiſe vnto many, that he will be in the middeſt of them: and beſides theſe, wee muſt giue our ſelues vnto priuate prayer in our families, that we and they may haue ſtrength thereby to beare all afflictions: and euery man and woman pray often by themſelues, for this is a ſpeciall meanes to haue faith and all other good gifts of God increaſed in vs: for Chriſt hath promiſed to giue to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that aske,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.7.</note> therfore now all ſhould ſtirre vp themſelues to all kinde of prayer, that wee might doe, as the Apoſtle willeth vs, namely, <hi>Pray alwaies with all manner prayer and ſupplication in the ſpirit;</hi>

And he ſpeaketh of all manner of prayer, to that end that we might vſe them all, as publikely and priuately, with our ſelues, and with others, that ſo God might bleſſe ſome or all of them, for the ſtrengthening of vs. And let vs pray for them that are ſick, who it may bee now in great paine and weaknes cannot pray for themſelues, that they might haue the fruite of their owne former prayers, and of others for them, that ſo they might be ſtrengthened from Sion: that is, from the means of Gods worſhip there vſed.

For in praying that he would turne his burnt offrings into aſhes, they haue reſpect vnto that which God had done in time paſt, namely, with fire from heauen he had conſumed the offrings of ſome that haue been made to him; whereby he did ſufficiently declare as by a demonſtratiue token, that he allowed of them, and had heard their prayers, that they offered with them.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7191:59"/> all things that all men euer haue done, are continually before him. But as among men, if we haue a ſuite to ſome great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and when we make it, that we might ſpeede the better, we bring ſome preſent vnto him alſo: and afterwards when wee are gone, we wiſh that he would remember vs, and our ſuite, and our gifts,<note place="margin">Or that he would ſmell them.</note> &amp; deale with vs accordingly: So they deſire that God would think vpon him, and vpon his ſuites that he made, and the gifts that hee brought, and deale with him in mercy thereafter. Some doe reade this text otherwiſe, but it tends all to one ende: namely that God would ſmell his gifts. Becauſe that in the time of the lawe vnto their oblations there was by the commandement of God, ſome incenſe adioyned &amp; burnt, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſetteth it down.<note place="margin">

For he is that Angell that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh of, who <hi>ſtoode before the altar,</hi>

And according to this phraſe of ſpeech it is ſaid of the ſacrifice of <hi>Noah;</hi> that he after

                  <hi>and tooke of euery cleane beaſt, and of euery cleane foule, and offered burnt offerings vpon the altar: and the Lord ſmelled a ſauour of reſt, &amp; the Lord ſaid in his heart, I will henceforth curſe the ground no more for mans cauſe. The Lord did ſmell,</hi> that is, he did accept the ſacrifices that were offered, and ſo he was pacified, and his anger did ceaſe, which for the ſinne of man was kindled iuſtly before, and cauſed the world to be drowned: but now his anger being ſtaied, he ſaid, that he would no more ſmite all things liuing as he had done. According to this kind of ſpeech vſuall in the Scripture, they pray, that God would bee well pleaſed with his prayers and ſeruice done vnto him.</p>
               <p>By this then we ſee,<note place="margin">God remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth all our ſeruices done to him.</note> that the prayers that we make to God at any time, and the ſeruices which wee owe vnto him, are not for the time preſent only, whileſt they are a doing (as ſome other things which periſh with the vſe of them) but they are alſo for the time to come: and God doth reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber them when they be paſt, and will bleſſe vs for them thereafter: and we may pray to God in faith that he would ſo doe, and are by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample taught to doe it with comfort. So that as incenſe burnt, or a perfume that is made, leaueth a good ſmell behind it, and the ſweet ſauours of it may be felt in the place where it was made a good while after: ſo our prayers and ſeruice done in faith are ſo acceptable vnto God for Chriſts ſake, that they leaue a ſauour of reſt behind them before God for vs, that hee may remember them, and vs for them. So that many dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we may think of it with ioy and delight, that we haue done ſo and ſo vnto God, and pray him to remember it, and be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that hee will doe ſo. This is a great mercy in God, that hee wil thus vouchſafe to remember vs and our poore ſeruices, and a great comfort to vs, to know that he doth ſo. Therefore euen as the ſinnes of men, that haue been done long ſince,<note place="margin">As he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth all the ſinnes of men to puniſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in time.</note> God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth them, and will puniſh them in time; and though men when they haue done them, forget them, and ſo make no account of them to repent them of them in time, but go on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely and careleſly, as it is ſaid of prophane <hi>Eſau,</hi> when he had ſold his birth-right, and ſo to ſatisfie his appetite for the time preſent, had departed from the greateſt teſtimony of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour

                  <note place="margin">If God deferre to help, we are ready to think that he hath forgotten vs.</note> So doth he remember all the ſeruices which men doe vnto him at any time, and they are euer preſent before him, and he neuer forgetteth any, and wil bleſſe them for the ſame in time. And though he defer this bleſſing of his, and do not preſently reward vs for our ſeruice, or deliuer vs when wee haue prayed vnto him: yet we muſt not thinke that therefore he forgetteth vs, and what we haue done, as though we had loſt our labour: which the diuel through our vnbeleefe is ready to ſuggeſt vnto vs;<note place="margin">

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7191:61" rendition="simple:additions"/> of, to whom the deſtruction of Ieruſalem was ſhewed in a viſion after this manner: <hi>He ſaw ſixe men with weapons in their hands, and one among them was clothed with linen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.3.</note> 
                  <hi>with a writers ynkhorne by his ſide: and the glorie of God appeared, and called to the man clothed with linen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And will bleſſe them for it, when others ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</note> 
                  <hi>which had the writers ynkhorne by his ſide: and ſaid vnto him, Goe through the middeſt of the the citie of Ieruſalem, and ſet a marke vpon the foreheards of them that mourne, and crie for all the abominations that are done in the middeſt thereof: and to the other he ſaid, Goe after him through the citie, and ſmite: let your eye ſpare none, neither haue pitie: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy vtterly the old and the yong, and the children, and the women: but touch no man, vpon whom is the marke.</hi> Thus wee ſee how in this great and vniuerſall deſtruction, wherein all ſorts old and yong, children and women were ſlaine, God remembred the ſorrow and griefe of thoſe that mourned for the abuſes of their time, and did ſpare them for it. And this bleſſing ſhall be vpon all thoſe, that deſire vnfainedly to ſerue God according to his word, when all the world beſides forſake it, they ſhall finde by experience, that God will remember them, and their doings, as he promiſed by the Prophet <hi>Malachi:</hi> where it is thus writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten (hee firſt complaining of the wicked, in the name of the Lord) <hi>Your words haue been ſtout againſt mee: yet yee ſay,</hi>

                     <hi>Malach.</hi> 3.13.</note> 
                  <hi>What haue we ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt thee? Ye haue ſaid, It is in vaine to ſerue God; and what profit is it that wee haue kept his commandements, and that wee haue walked humbly before the Lord of hostes? therefore we count the proud bleſſed: euen they that worke wickednes, are ſet vp, and they that tempt God, yea they are deliuered. Then ſpake they that feared the Lord euery one to his neighbour, and the Lord hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened and heard, and a booke of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord: and they ſhall be to me, ſaith the Lord of hostes, in that day that I ſhall doe this, for a flocke, and I will ſpare them, as a man ſpareth his owne ſonne, that ſerueth him.</hi> Thus we ſee that when the Prophet preached, and ſome made a mock of it, and thoſe that feared God, conferd among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to comfort themſelues in the waies of the Lord, hee did ſee them both, and did remember them, and in the day of his viſitation would put a difference betweene them: and ſo wee ſee how God will remember vs for our faithfull ſeruice, and bleſſe vs for it: and to that end according to our capacitie it is
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7191:62" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſaid, that there was a booke of remembrance written for them before the Lord. That is, as among men they that do any faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruice to the Prince, it is recorded in writing and put into the Chronicles, whereby it commeth to paſſe that the memory of it is kept: as wee ſee in the booke of <hi>Hester,</hi> when the King could not ſleepe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hest.</hi> 6.1.</note> hee commaunded to bring the booke of the Chronicles, and they were read before him: where it was found written, that <hi>Mordecas</hi> had told of <hi>Bigtana</hi> and <hi>Tereſh</hi> two of the Kings Eunuches, keepers of the doore, who ſought to lay hands on the King. And hee ſaid, What honour and dignitie hath bin done to him for this? And they ſaid, There is nothing done for him. Then he commaunded <hi>Haman</hi> to doe him that great honour, that is there ſet down. Thus we ſee how the good ſeruice that he had done to the King was written, and ſo he was remembred &amp; rewarded for it. So the Lord doth keepe a more faithfull record of all the good ſeruices that any of vs haue done vnto him, and hee will reward vs for them in his good time: and this is that which they pray for in the behalfe of their King.</p>
               <p>When the Lord ſent his Angels to deſtroy Sodome and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrha, and the cities thereabout for their horrible wickednes, he made it knowne vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi>

                     <hi>Chapt.</hi> 19.29.</note> 
                  <hi>God thought vpon Abraham, and ſent Lot out from the middeſt of the deſtruction, when hee ouerthrew the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, wherein Lot dwelled.</hi> By this example wee ſee that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth the prayers that wee haue made not onely for our ſelues, but for others, yea when they know not of it, as hee did
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7191:62" rendition="simple:additions"/> the prayers of <hi>Abraham</hi> for <hi>Lot.</hi> Therefore when wee pray to God, wee muſt not thinke that our words are vaniſhed in the ayre, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are for the time preſent only, but for the time to come, euen for all the daies of our life. So that, as it is ſaid, that the bloud of <hi>Abel</hi> did ſpeake to God for him when hee was dead, and did crie out alowd and was heard:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chapt.</hi> 4.10.</note> ſo our prayers that we haue made, and ſeruices that we haue done, ſhall ſpeak to God for vs when wee ſleepe, and when wee hold our peace, and God will remember vs for them, euen then when hee puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth all the wicked round about vs; as he did here heare <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and deliuered <hi>Lot</hi> when hee ouerthrew the cities of the plaine, wherein <hi>Lot</hi> dwelled.</p>
               <p>We haue prayed often for this viſitation,<note place="margin">God remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth the prayers of all men for this plague.</note> that God would be mercifull vnto vs in it: we muſt not thinke, that becauſe we ſee not a preſent end, or leſſening of it, that we haue loſt our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and ſo grow wearie, and giue ouer. But let vs aſſure our ſelues, that ſo many as haue with true repentance and vnfained purpoſe of leauing all ſinnes that they know, and not wittingly pleaſe themſelues in any: that God remembreth their prayers, and knoweth what is in them, and what they haue done to him: as he alſo knoweth the hard-heartednes and hypocriſie of the reſt. And as hee doth remember them, ſo hee will in his good time make it knowne to them more and more: as hee did to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> when he ſent an Angel vnto him, and as he did to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> when he ſaw that <hi>Lot</hi> was deliuered from the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sodom. Hee did remember them before, though hee made it knowne vnto them, when it pleaſed him.<note place="margin">And in time will ſhew it vnto them.</note> As it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten alſo of <hi>Daniel</hi> the Prophet, who faſted and prayed for the deſolation of Ieruſalem; whileſt he was ſpeaking in prayer, <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi> came flying, and foretold him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.21.</note> about the euening ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and ſaid, <hi>O Daniel, I am now come foorth, to giue thee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and vnderstanding: at the beginning of thy ſupplications the commandement came forth, and I am come to ſhew thee.</hi> So though there the commaundement came out at the firſt, yet God did ſhew it him at the laſt, euen when it pleaſed him.<note place="margin">God muſt needs remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber vs: for Chriſt putteth him in minde of vs.</note> So will he doe with vs; but in the meane ſeaſon we muſt beleeue that he doth remember vs, and take comfort in it. And truly it muſt needs be ſo, that God ſhould remember the prayers of his ſeruants, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7191:63"/> all their ſeruices,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34.</note> for they haue a Mediatour and Aduocate in heauen, euen Ieſus Chriſt at the right hand of God, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth continuall requeſt for vs; for hee is faithfull to doe it, and he is in fauour with God, and therfore he will remember vs for his ſake. For if wee haue put vp any ſupplication to the King, and we haue one in the Court to follow it, wee hope wee ſhall not be forgotten: eſpecially if wee haue the Prince the Kings eldeſt ſonne to make ſuite for vs. So ſeeing Chriſt Ieſus doth deale for vs in heauen, wee may bee aſſured that God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member all prayers made according to his will in repentance and faith. Therefore if wee haue done any thing all this while, God will remember vs, if wee haue done nothing, then God muſt needes forget to bleſſe vs, for there is nothing done, for which he might remember vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">This ſhould make vs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and in all good things.</note>This ſhould make al men feruent in prayer, &amp; forward in all duties, that ſo they might leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as it were) with God, and they might bee before him night and day, for a remembrance of them. And that as we haue many ſinnes, for which hee may remember to puniſh vs; ſo our repentance, faith, prayer, ſeruice done to his Maieſtie, obedience to his word of conſcience in al his commaundements, and that in ſecret, and all the good that we haue done to our brethren, might alſo ſpeak for vs, and put him in remembrance of vs for our good. That as it is written of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> that worthie ſeruant of God, who often in the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of a good conſcience prayeth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.14</note>

               <p>And whereas they pray for the King, that God would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member all his prayers, and ſeruices: we ſee that we may not onely pray to God, that hee would remember what wee haue done, and that we now doe, and what we haue done before the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7191:63"/> ſtaying of this viſitation, and hope that he will remember all, nay, be aſſured of it.<note place="margin">Pray for them vnder the Plague, that God would remember their former ſeruices, though now they can doe none.</note> But pray alſo for all our brethren in al pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that God would remember what they haue prayed and done, and the faſts that haue beene in all places, and are ſtill, and that all our prayers together may ſtill ſpeake for vs. Yea, we may pray that God would heare them that are viſited with his hand, and not only that which they now pray, but that that they haue done before, when they were in health: and though they cannot do as they would, nay, it may be for paine ſpeake one word as hee requireth, yet if they haue done any thing in truth before, that he would now in this time of their neede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that, and them for it, and ſo no doubt he will. And this is a ſingular fruite of thoſe that neglect not the time of prayer and of Gods ſeruice when they may, that they ſhall bee remembred for it hereafter, and for that which they haue done before, when for the time preſent they ſhall be able to doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: as <hi>Dauid</hi> when he was fighting could not alwaies pray as he would, and as his need required, but hee deſireth them to pray that God would remember that which hee had prayed before, when he was able to doe it.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The ſecond part of this verſe.</note> This is the ſecond part of the verſe, where they pray, that God would turne his burnt offerings into aſhes, that is, that God would ſome waies declare that he had heard his prayer, and receiued his ſeruices: for where hee ſpeaketh of ſacrifices, it was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manner of Gods ſeruice in thoſe dayes, where they did ſo offer, but theſe were not without prayer, as we ſee in the fourth verſe in this Pſalme. By which prayer they ſought to God, that thoſe ſins for which they did offer ſacrifices, might be pardoned in the death of Chriſt, whereof thoſe ſacrifices, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially whole burnt offerings were a type and figure, to ſhew that Chriſt ſhould wholy offer vp himſelfe to God for vs. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid, that the Prieſt when they brought their ſacrifices,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>and there came a fire out from the Lord, and conſumed vpon the alter the burnt offering and the fat: which when the people ſaw, they gaue thankes, and fell on their faces.</hi> Thus when the ſacrifice was laid vpon the altar, fire came from the Lord, and conſumed it; and ſo the people when they ſaw it, gaue thanks: for by this ſigne they did ſee, that God did alow of the ſacrifice of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and of his Prieſthood.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">And of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note>So again when <hi>Salomon</hi> dedicated the temple, &amp; had made a long and zealous prayer for all thoſe that ſhould pray in that houſe,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.1.</note> and had prepared a ſacrifice to be offred: <hi>Fire came from heauen, and conſumed the burnt offering, and the glory of the Lord filled the temple:</hi> ſo that by this ſigne God did ſhew to them all, that hee had heard the prayer of <hi>Salomon,</hi> for the hallowing of that houſe to be the houſe of prayer for al nations.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E heard the laſt day the meaning of theſe words,<note place="margin">They pray that God would ſhew that he had heard his prayers.</note> and the reaſon of this kind of ſpeech, that they deſire the Lord, to turne his burnt offerings into aſhes. The thing that they pray for is this, that God would ſome way ſhew that he had heard his prayers. He did not then ſo pray, as though hee cared not whether hee was heard or no, reſting in the bare worke of prayer: but he was very deſirous that God would heare him, ſo that hee willeth them to pray, that God would ſhew it to him and them, that hee had heard them in deede. It is not enough then for vs to pray vnto God, and to beleeue that he doth heare vs; but to waite vpon him for the performance thereof, and to be deſirous to ſee it: ſo ſhall wee be comforted, and God ſhall be praiſed. Many come hether to the Church ſo careleſly to pray, that when all is done, they doe not ſo much as knowe what hath been prayed for; ſo farre are they from this, of deſiring to ſee, or marking how their praiers are heard: and ſo either they receiue nothing, or if they doe, they ſee it not; or if they ſee it, they do not obſerue and marke it, to bee thankfull vnto God, and to bee confirmed thereby in hope of his goodnes for the time to come. <hi>Dauid</hi> prayeth in this faith, that he doubted not but that God would heare him,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7191:65"/> and ſo deſireth them to pray, that he would ſhew it to him ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly and plainely as hee did to thoſe whoſe ſacrifices he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with fire, and turned into aſhes, by cauſing it to come downe from heauen vpon them.<note place="margin">We muſt ſo pray that we be deſirous to ſee that God hath heard our prayers.</note> So muſt we doe in all things that we pray for, not only beleeue that God will heare vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promiſes, but alſo pray him, that hee would ſome way in his good time euidently ſhew by the euent, that he hath heard vs. When we put vp our ſuites vnto princes and great men, if they ſay they ſhal be granted, we neuer leaue, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till we haue the things that wee ſue for, or that there be ſome act done for vs, that it may appeare that they haue heard vs in deed. The Lord hath commanded vs to aske, and hath made a promiſe that he will giue,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.7.</note> ſaying, <hi>Aske and it ſhall be giuen you, ſeeke and yee ſhall finde, knocke and it ſhall be opened vnto you.</hi> Say then that wee haue asked of God and ſought vnto him, and that we beleeue alſo that we ſhall receiue from him according to our asking; let vs then come againe vnto him the ſecond time, that either by granting the thing, or ſome thing for it, or ſupplying the want of it, or ſome way or other as it ſhal pleaſe him, that we might ſee that he hath heard vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">And namely, that he hath heard the prayers of all for this plague.</note>As for example (and this very time doth put vs in minde of it) wee haue prayed long and often for the remouing of this grieuous viſitation of the peſtilence: God no doubt hath heard ſo many all this time as haue called vpon him in truth, &amp; haue departed from iniquitie; and hee doth well remember what they haue ſaid and done vnto him, and hee will in time bleſſe them for it accordingly: this is that that al of vs ſhould beleeue. But wee muſt now with new ſuites and ſupplications ſecond theſe prayers of ours, to this effect, that God would ſhew vs that hee hath heard vs; either by cauſing this contagion and mortalitie to ceaſe, or ſome way extending fauour vnto vs in it. And wee muſt deſire to bee partakers of the prayers of our brethren, that by the benefit of their praiers, we might ſee that God hath heard vs; as <hi>Dauid</hi> here was deſirous and willed the people to pray for him to that end. And as they doe thus pray for the King, that God would ſhew that hee had heard his prayers; ſo we alſo are to pray for them that are in trouble, and namely vnder this hand of God, that he would ſhew to them
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7191:65"/> that he hath heard their prayers.<note place="margin">They that pray for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion and coldly, cannot thus doe.</note> All they that pray coldly and for faſhion, and ſo care not whether they bee heard or no, or marke not what they haue prayed for, but vtter words of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome without deſiring or feeling, cannot with any comfort make this ſecond prayer for any thing, namely, that God would ſhew them that he hath heard their prayers. But al thoſe that pray in the inward ſenſe and feeling of their wants, and in the faith of Gods promiſes, and ſo not onely know what they pray, but are deſirous to haue their requeſts granted, and look for the fulfilling of them; when they haue prayed moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, they muſt come againe vnto God the ſecond and third time, and deſire him that he would ſhew by effect, that he hath heard their prayers. Seeing then that God is the hearer of prayers, as <hi>Dauid</hi> calleth him, <hi>O thou that hearest the prayer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 65.2.</note> 
                  <hi>to thee ſhall all fleſh come;</hi> and hee hath made many promiſes to thoſe that ſeeke vnto him in their need, that they ſhall not returne away emptie: let vs neuer ceaſe calling vpon him both for the taking away of this great iudgement, and for all things that we want, vntill he ſhew, that he hath heard our prayers: ſo ſhall wee ſee it in the ende, as this people did, for in the next Pſalme they giue thanks for that which here they pray for.</p>
               <p>Now whereas hee teacheth them thus to pray,<note place="margin">That wee might ſee how God heareth our prayers, we muſt mark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> what follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth vpon them.</note> that God would ſome way, as it pleaſed him, declare that hee had heard their prayers; it was meete and conuenient, and this muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be preſumed, that after prayers they ſhould waite vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, and marke the courſe of his prouidence, and conſider what ſhould follow, that ſo thereby they might beleeue that God had heard them in deed. Els it might wel come to paſſe, that God for his part ſhould ſufficiently ſhew that hee had heard him, but they ſhould not regarde it, and ſo they ſhould make this prayer in vaine, that hee would ſhew that hee heard heard him, for he hath done it already, but they ſee it not. For to make this poynt more plaine in that very compariſon that is here vſed, if when the ſacrifice was offered, and God did with fire from heauen burne it vp cleane, and ſo turne it into aſhes, as he did it to <hi>Aaron,</hi> to <hi>Salomon,</hi> &amp; to <hi>Elijah,</hi> as we haue ſeene before; he that was there preſent being blind could not ſee it, or if he turned himſelfe from it another way. So if we be
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7191:66"/> wilfully or careleſly blind in the works of God, &amp; do not mark what followeth vpon our prayers, good or euill; wee ſhall vſe this prayer in vaine, to pray that God would ſhew that he hath heard our prayers; for he hath done it ſufficiently, but we doe not regard it. Therfore it is meet for all men not only to know and to wey what they pray for, and to marke it well, and to thinke of it afterwards; but to waite vpon God for the ſame, and to conſider what followeth, that ſo they may ſee how God heareth them. For as when a man putteth vp a ſupplication to the King, he is not quiet then, but his minde is running as wee ſay, vpon it, and he is very inquiſitiue what is done in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and he marketh all things that follow, to ſee whether they make with him or againſt him, that ſo he might ſee whether it bee graciouſly receiued or no: So ought wee to doe in our prayers vnto God, haue our minds, as it were lingering after the things prayed for, and marke how euery thing that follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, may put vs in hope that God hath heard vs. And this is that that <hi>Dauid</hi> profeſſeth of himſelfe in his prayer.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 5.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Heare my voyce in the morning, O Lord, for in the morning will I direct mee vnto thee, and I will waite:</hi> where hee ſaith, that hee would doe as ſutors doe; they put vp their ſuite, and then giue their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance for an anſwere; ſo hee would pray to God ſpeedely and carefully, and then he would conſider what followed, that ſo he might ſee how God did heare him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Thus ſhould we doe, when we pray at morning, and at euening. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.1.</note>So muſt wee all doe, when wee haue prayed to God for any thing, we muſt waite vpon him, and conſider what followeth. And <hi>Dauid</hi> confeſſeth that in ſo doing, hee did ſee plainly, that God had heard him. For ſo hee ſaith, <hi>I waited patiently for the Lord, and he inclined vnto me, and heard my crie:</hi> and ſo ſhall we doe, if we continue to pray vnto him, and waite vpon him. So that when we pray to God in the morning, we ſhould conſider how things fall out all the day after, well or ill, that wee might ſee how God in beſtowing many bleſſings vpon vs hath heard our prayers. Likewiſe at night when wee goe to bed, and pray to God, that hee would defend vs from daungers, and giue vs quiet reſt, and we awake in the morning, and haue our ſtrength renewed for the workes of our calling, and al things well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the doores and without; theſe things though they be ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7191:66"/> we ſhould wel marke, that ſo we might ſee and confeſſe, that God did heare our prayers, and ſo be thankfull vnto him for the ſame. And ſo in al iourneis that we take in hand, or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that we go about, wherein we haue commended our waies vnto God, as we ſhould alwaies doe becauſe vpon his bleſſing dependeth the ſucceſſe of all things, we ſhould mark how they ſucceed and proſper with vs, that ſo we might ſee how he hath turned our burnt offrings into aſhes, that is, how hee heareth our prayers. So likewiſe for this ſicknes,<note place="margin">And in all the prayers that are and haue been made for this peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> that hath been a long time amongſt vs; wee haue prayed vnto God to be mercifull vnto vs in it, and to ſhew vs ſome token of his fauour: and wee are deſirous alſo to ſee that hee hath heard our prayers: now then let vs conſider if the extremitie of it be ſtaied from increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any where, or if it be kept out from many places, where it was likely that it ſhould come, as out of this countrie, and out of this towne; that ſo we might confeſſe to the glorie of God, and our owne comfort, that God hath heard our prayers. And this is one ſpeciall vſe of the newes, that we heare weekly from London, Norwich, and other places infected, how many died this weeke, how many the laſt; how many of the plague, and how many of other diſeaſes; how many pariſhes infected, and how many are cleere, that ſo we might ſee from week to week, and from day to day, that the Lord heareth our prayers, that ſo by experience wee might bee moued ſtill to call vpon him for that that remaineth.<note place="margin">Or when wee pray in the Church for any that lie ſicke.</note> So when wee haue prayed here in the Church for any particular perſon (as we haue done for diuers, and doe daily) whereof ſome haue been at deaths doore, and yet haue been recouered; wee ſhould haue kept a regiſter of them, and haue marked them a great deale better than we haue done: and it had been happie for vs at this time if we had done ſo, that ſo we might haue by great experience been confirmed in the truth of this, that God doth heare our prayers. And to be ſhort, if any of vs haue bin in pouertie, or in any want, and haue prayed to God to helpe vs; then we muſt marke and conſider, how he ſtirreth vp ſome to haue a care of vs,<note place="margin">Or who haue been in pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or in any need. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20.</note> and how ſome do pitie vs, or any way how wee be prouided for; and thus wiſely obſerue all Gods dealing according to our prayers in euery eſtate of ours. That as the inuiſible things of God, as his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7191:67"/> wiſedom and power, and mercy, and truth are to be ſeen in the gouernment of the world &amp; are in his creatures as it were written in great capitall letters for the moſt ignorant to ſee and reade, to leaue them without excuſe, ſo wee might in the ſame wiſely diſcerne and ſee them, and be accordingly affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſame to beleeue in him, and to bee thankfull vnto him, that thus from time to time ſheweth that hee doth heare our prayers. And truly if wee had thus done all the daies of our life, and in euery thing that we haue praied for; we might haue ſeene better than now wee doe, or can doe, how many times God hath heard vs, for our ſelues, and for others, day &amp; night, at home and abroad,<note place="margin">Then might we often haue ſeen how God did heare our prayers.</note> in the Church and in our houſes. And for want of this diligent obſeruation, (the more is our loſſe, and the greater ſhould be our griefe) though God hath done many great things at our prayers, and hath declared by bleſſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents that he hath heard vs, yet we haue not conſidered of it, and ſo haue not ſeene it; and ſo doe want the comfort of this that they doe pray for here, euen that God would turne their burnt offrings into aſhes, that is, ſhew that he did heare their prayers.</p>
               <p>Now that wee might come to a more conſcionable practiſe of this, we may conſider what will follow: firſt of all, when we doe deſire to haue our prayers heard, and will accordingly marke the dealing of God towards vs,<note place="margin">If we marke how God hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, we ſhall the more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of the benefits that we receiue. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 21.3.</note> it will come to paſſe that we ſhall greatly eſteeme of thoſe benefits that are thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon vs, and be much affected with them; and ſo wee ſhall be the more thankfull to God for them. For though wee ought highly to eſteeme and make great account of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God in the benefits that he beſtoweth vpon vs vnasked, in that he preuenteth vs with his liberall bleſsings, as the Pſ l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſaith; and I cannot tell whether wee ſhould not doe it a great deale more: yet ſuch is our nature for the moſt part, that we eſteeme of things the more, the more hardly that wee come by them, and the more paines that we take for them. Hereupon it commeth to paſſe, that when we haue prayed earneſtly vnto God, and ſo haue gotten things that way, and haue taken ſome paines for them, then ſhall wee thinke our ſelues the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to God for them. Euen as when a man hath obtained
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7191:67"/> a thing by long ſuite, and it hath coſt him much, then if it bee granted to him at the laſt, he will eſteem of the thing the more, and think himſelfe the more beholding to him that hath gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it. Therefore we our ſelues when in the morning wee pray to God to bleſſe vs in his waies that day, and to proſper vs in al our actions, and then obſerue how the Lord preſerueth vs from much euil that might befall vs, and doth much good to vs, that wee were vnworthie of; ſhall wee not greatly reioyce in this goodnes of his, and be thankfull vnto him for the ſame? And likewiſe at night when wee commend our bodies and ſoules, and all that wee haue to his bleſſed protection, that hee would keepe vs waking and ſleeping; and finde in the morning that he hath done ſo indeed; ſhall we not in the obſeruation of this mercifull prouidence of God towards vs, bee confirmed in his goodnes to be thankfull vnto him for it? And ſo in any trouble and danger that we ſhall be in much more, wherein we do pray to him to preſerue and bleſſe vs;<note place="margin">As in this time of the plague.</note> as when wee pray to him in this deadly ſickneſſe of the plague, for ſome fauour in it; and then marke how things fall out, that they are better rather than worſe, and ſo therein ſee the goodneſſe of God towards our ſelues and others; ſhall wee not reioyce in Gods deliuerance, and be ſo much the more thankfull vnto him for the ſame? Euen as wee ſee <hi>Dauid</hi> and this people doe here: for they are not onely thankfull to God for it, but they ſay, that they doe greatly reioyce that God had heard their prayers.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>The King ſhal reioyce in thy ſtrength, O Lord, yea how greatly ſhall he reioyce in thy ſaluation? for thou haſt giuen him his hearts deſire, and haſt not denied him the requeſt of his lips.</hi> And ſo did that godly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Hannah</hi> the wife of <hi>Elkanah,</hi> when ſhe prayed in the temple for a ſonne, and God gaue her one, for ſhe went home and preſently conceiued, though ſhe had been barren a long time before; ſhe did ſo marke the iſſue and what followed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her prayers, and the prayers of <hi>Hely</hi> the Prieſt for her, that ſhe confeſſeth to him, that God had giuen her that that ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, ſaying, <hi>O my Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.36.</note> 
                  <hi>I am the woman that ſtood with thee here praying, I prayed for this child, and the Lord hath giuen me my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire:</hi> and therefore ſhe did not only conſecrate him vnto God; as the beſt gift that ſhe could beſtow vpon him, but maketh a

                     <hi>Chapt.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5.</note>

Whereas on the contrarie when wee neglect this; many great things, which God giueth vs, either we regard not at all, or at the leaſt not as we ſhould, and ſo God hath not that praiſe from vs for them, that is due.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">By this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation we ſhal grow in hope of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes for the time to come. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.4.5.</note>Secondarily, by this obſeruation of Gods dealing towards vs after our prayers, it will come to paſſe, that wee ſhall grow in faith and hope of Gods goodneſſe towards vs for the time to come; and ſo wee ſhall be imboldened to pray to him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, becauſe we haue ſeene and marked how hee hath heard vs before. For (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>experience breedeth hope, and hope maketh not aſhamed, becauſe the loue of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt:</hi> that is, former experience ſhal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme vs in Gods loue, and ſo giue that hope for the time to come, that confoundeth not. And truly if wee had marked all our former experience this way publike and priuate, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, and for what God hath heard our prayers; what great hope might wee haue had of it now in this time of our neede? When we could haue ſaid,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.37.</note> as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, <hi>God that deliuered mee from the paw of the lion, and from the paw of the beare, will deliuer me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this vncircumciſed Philistim:</hi> that is, God that hath heard me at ſuch and ſuch a time, I hope will heare me now. But for want of this we are new to ſeeke in any great danger, as though God had neuer giuen vs any thing at our prayers before: and that maketh vs alſo to haue ſo little hope now.<note place="margin">And by the ſame we ſhall confirme o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in their hope.</note> Thirdly, we ſhal be able to confirme others alſo by our owne experience, and incourage them to cal vpon God with good hope by our own example: for we ſhall be able to ſay vnto them, that wee haue obſerued how God hath dealt with vs in the like caſe of theirs: and this ſhall be no ſmall comfort to them to heare it: or to our ſelues from others, to heare at their mouth, how God hath
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7191:68"/> dealt with them in former times. And ſo doth <hi>Dauid</hi> to this end ſpeake to other of his owne experience which he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, by marking how God dealt with him after his prayers; when he ſaith, <hi>This poore man cried, and the Lord heard him, and ſaued him out of all his troubles.</hi> And a little before:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>I ſought the Lord, and he heard me, yea he deliuered me out of my feare: they ſhall looke to him, and runne to him, and their faces ſhall not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſaying, This poore man cried, and the Lord heard him.</hi> We ſee how confidently hee ſpeaketh vnto others, and aſſureth them, that if they pray to God, he will heare them: for hee had well marked how the Lord had ſo dealt with him before. Let vs then in all things wherein we haue prayed vnto God, ſo marke his dealing towards vs, that we may ſee how he hath turned our burnt offrings into aſhes, that is, how he hath declared vnto vs, that he hath heard our prayers, that ſo we may reioyce in Gods benefits the more, and hee may bee praiſed for them, and our ſelues and others be confirmed in hope by experience through them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Turne thy burnt offrings into aſhes.</hi> Laſtly, concerning theſe words, wheras in them he teacheth generally to pray,<note place="margin">We muſt not limit the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our prayers to any one particular thing.</note> that God would ſhew that he had heard his prayers, and doth not limit it to any particular thing, as to ſay, ſhew it, by doing ſo and ſo: but that concerning the things that be prayed for, hee deſireth that hee would ſhew which way it pleaſeth him, that hee had heard them, and that hee and they might as euidently ſee it, as thoſe did who had their ſacrifices conſumed with fire from heauen: It teacheth vs, that in al outward things eſpecially, we ſhould not tye the fauour of God, and the hearing of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to any one ſpeciall thing, as to ſay, If God would giue me ſuch a thing, that I haue prayed for, or deale ſo and ſo with me, I would beleeue that he had heard my prayers, but vntill I haue that, I cannot be perſwaded of it. For in all things we ought to pray, that God would giue vs ſuch and ſuch things, ſo farre foorth as it is his holy will, as he knoweth it to be good for vs, and for his glorie: and with theſe conditions alſo muſt wee pray for others. So then if the Lord ſee it not expedient for vs, and ſo doe not giue it vs at all, or when we would haue it, or in that manner that wee would: yet wee muſt deſire this, that hee
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7191:69"/> would ſome way ſhew that he hath heard our prayers: by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs minds readie to ſubmit our wils vnto his, &amp; patience to beare things; and that hee would giue vs ſome thing els for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence or ſupplie of it, and that hee would turne all to our good, and that we might alſo ſee it to be ſo; and this muſt be ſufficient for all.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.</note> 
                  <hi>For we many times know not what to pray, as wee ought, but the ſpirit of God in vs maketh request then for vs vnto God with ſighes and groanes, which cannot be expreſſed:</hi> and the Lord who is the ſearcher of the hearts,<note place="margin">For God will giue not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that that we name, but that his ſpirit in vs meaneth.</note> knoweth what is the meaning of the Spirit, for it maketh requeſt for the Saints, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that that they asked or named, which in temptation the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues knew not well, but according to the meaning of the ſpirit in them.

This is worthy to be diligently obſerued, becauſe we are

                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.18.</note> that as any thing ſeemeth more needfull, ſo we more earneſtly deſire that.

               <p>Secondarily, when he teacheth them thus to pray, that God would ſhew that he had fauourably accepted his prayers,<note place="margin">Wee muſt thinke it a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard thing to doe any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, ſo as God may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it.</note> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings, and all ſeruices that he had done to him, and then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>Selah.</hi> This note of ſtirring vp the affection, it was to ſhew how hee thought of this thing, euen that it was a great thing to do any ſeruice, or to offer vp any prayers, that might be acceptable vnto God: therefore that it might be ſo, that is, well pleaſing in his eyes, it was to bee commended vnto him againe and againe. And truly thus muſt we thinke of the ſeruice of God, and we ſhall finde, that if we conſider rightly
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7191:74"/> the high maieſtie of God, and what is meete for him on the one ſide, and then our owne vnworthines and inſufficiencie to bring any thing at all vnto him on the other ſide; we muſt needes confeſſe, that it is a very hard thing to doe any thing after that manner, that hee may vouchſafe once to regard it. Euery thing is not meete for him, it muſt bee agreeable vnto his word, otherwiſe he refuſeth our will-worſhip, and ſaith, <hi>Who hath required theſe things at your hands?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.12.</note> So then we muſt not obtrude vnto him our owne blind deuotions as they did in the time of Poperie.

                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 9 31.</note> but if any be a worſhipper of him, and doth his will, him he heareth. And for want of this he refuſed the very ſacrifices and oblations of the Iewes, yea their ſolemne faſtings, as wee may ſee in the Prophet: and namely in the Prophet <hi>Eſay.</hi>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7191:75"/> him, of his comming, and of his ſeruice. And this wee had neede to bee put in minde of, becauſe men for the moſt part are more carefull about their owne buſines,<note place="margin">Men vſe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diligence about their owne buſines, than about Gods ſeruice.</note> yea about other mens buſines that all may be well done, than about Gods. In the ſixe daies of the weeke how buſie are men at home? but vpon the ſeuenth day, which is the Lords, and ſo called in the Scripture, how ſlowly doe they come, &amp; how ſleepely do they behaue themſelues here? as though it made no matter at all how they ſerued God. Yea ſeruants are commonly more diligent about their maſters buſines at home, more carefull to pleaſe, and more loath to offend, than they are in the Church about the Lords buſines: and ſo they ſhew by their deedes, that though it be an hard thing to pleaſe their maſters, yet (as they think) it is an eaſie thing to pleaſe God. Why doth <hi>Dauid</hi> then deſire them ſo earneſtly to pray, that God would fauourably accept his ſeruices, and to inforce them vnto it doth adde this word, <hi>Selah,</hi> if it were ſo eaſie a matter to ſerue God, as they imagine, and that hee were bound to take any thing at our hands?</p>
               <p>We ſee then by this that few men in deed know rightly, what it is to ſerue God, when they come to it ſo hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally and ſo coldly. But euery one as they are deſirous to ſerue God in truth (as <hi>Dauid</hi> was here) ſo they finde it to be more hard to doe any thing in ſuch manner,<note place="margin">But the beſt ſeruants of God haue thought ſo highly of his ſeruice, that when they haue done the beſt, they haue found fault with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that they haue done no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37.</note> as may bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto him. And this is that that the beſt ſeruants of God, that haue been tender hearted haue found fault with themſelues for, and haue beene greatly troubled in their minds about; not ſo much for any great ſinnes that they haue committed, which by the grace of God they haue been free from; as that their prayers that they haue made, haue not been in that faith, and feeling, in that power of the ſpirit and aſſurance of being heard, that they ſhould, and ſo God might reiect them: and that in other part of his ſeruice they haue fayled, or that they haue not trembled at his word, nor been pricked at the heart, when they heard their ſinnes laid open, as thoſe did that are ſpoken of in the Actes of the Apoſtles: but that they haue been hard hearted rather, and not ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as they ſhould. So that they haue had a godly feare, that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7191:75"/> their beſt ſeruices might haue been refuſed. And <hi>Dauid</hi> this holy man of God it ſeemeth, being priuie to the corruption of his owne heart, was ſomewhat afraide, that all that ſeruice which he had done, was not as it ſhuld be, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired the people, and by this note, <hi>Selah,</hi> did pricke them forward thereunto, that God would accept with fauour his ſeruices, and ſhew by the euent that he had done ſo. And this is that godly ielouſie that <hi>Iob</hi> had of his children in the dayes of their feaſting together, which cauſed him to doe as it is written of him.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.5.</note> 
                  <hi>And when the dayes of their banqueting were gone about, Iob ſent, and ſanctified them, and roſe vp early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Iob thought, it may be that my ſonnes haue ſinned and blasphemed God in their hearts: thus did Iob euery day.</hi> When they had done feaſting, the next day hee called them to the ſacrifice and ſeruice of God; but that they might doe it, as they ſhould, hee bad them ſanctifie themſelues, that ſo they might come holily to it, as they ought: ſo that he would not haue them come ſuddenly from feaſting to the ſacrifices, as though it made no matter how they ſerued God, but bad them prepare themſelues: and beſides he ſaith, <hi>it may be they haue not bleſſed God in their hearts,</hi> that is, they haue not ſo ſerued God, and giuen thankes to him from their hearts, as they ſhould haue done. So that the beſt ſeruants of God knowing what an hard thing it is to ſerue God, haue been deſirous to doe all things ſo, that they might be approoued vnto him: and when they haue done beſt, they haue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what feared that they haue not done ſo: and ſo haue earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired to ſee ſome way, that God had accepted of their ſeruices and prayers.</p>
               <p>Contrarie to this, the hypocrites and all formall men,<note place="margin">The hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites thinke that any kinde of ſeruice is good enough for God.</note> who know not what Gods ſeruice doth meane, they thinke, that if they doe any outward ſeruice to him here in the Church, or elſewhere, hee is bound to take it, let it bee done after what manner it will be; and they thinke that they haue great wrong offred, if it be not. And this is that which the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> ſpeaketh of: <hi>Ye offer vncleane bread vpon mine altar,</hi>

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it be an hard thing to preſent the King with any thing that hee may like of, and they that vndertake ſuch a matter, will vſe all diligence to that end: then we much more muſt be perſwaded, that it is a very hard thing to doe any ſeruice of prayer or otherwiſe vnto God, ſo as may be acceptable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: and ſo prepare our ſelues for it, and be carefull to do all things in that manner. Yea and when we haue done all, let vs pray vnto God to forgiue the weaknes and imperfection of our ſeruices, and to accept them in the righteouſneſſe and perfect obedience of Chriſt.

As if they had ſaid, Let God heare his prayers, &amp;c. Oh what a great bleſsing of God were that? how ſhould we be bound to him for it? what great cauſe ſhould we haue to be thankfull? So then when they prayed for it, hee would haue them eſteeme it as no common benefit, and haue that affection to it. Therefore when God had thus done, hee doth not onely make another Pſalme for the Church to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God for it: but when in the ſame hee commeth to make mention of this very thing, that they pray for here, namely, that God had ſhewed, that he had heard his prayer, he addeth this <hi>Selah</hi> againe.

Here then wee are taught to make great account of this, that God at any time doth heare our prayers, whatſoeuer we pray for. And as wee muſt make this account before hand, when we doe pray; ſo afterwards alſo. If we pray for any thing for ſoule or bodie; for our ſelues or any of ours: for the Church or Common-wealth, wee muſt thus thinke: Oh if God will heare my prayers and giue me this thing, how ſhall I be beholding to him for it al the daies of my life?<note place="margin">So did Iacob alſo. <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20.</note> So doth <hi>Iacob</hi> in that prayer that hee made when hee went towards <hi>Laban,</hi> as may appeare by his words: <hi>If God will be with me, and will keepe me in this iourney which I go, and will giue me bread to eate, and cloathes to put on; ſo that I come againe vnto my fathers houſe in ſafetie, and if thou wilt be my God: then this ſtone, which I haue ſet vp as a pillar, ſhall bee Gods houſe; and of all that thou ſhalt giue me, I will giue the tenth vnto thee.</hi> And truly it muſt needes be ſo,<note place="margin">So muſt we doe, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider our great wants.</note> if we doe but conſider our great neede of euery thing, and what wee are if God doe not ſupplie them.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7191:78"/> himſelfe, ſhould come and aske almes, and receiue; muſt not he needes thinke, how am I beholding to him that hath thus refreſhed me? and what ſhould haue become of mee, poore ſoule, if hee had not had compaſsion on me? As <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith of himſelfe, that he did feede the hungrie, and clothe the naked, ſo that the very bellies of them that were fed with his meat,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job.</hi> 31.20.</note> and the loynes of them that were cloathed with the fleece of his ſheepe did bleſſe him. So then when wee ſee, that if God doe not thus and thus for vs, we are readie to periſh, muſt we not thinke, that if hee doe, and when hee doth beſtow it, wee ſhall haue great cauſe to praiſe him for it? We muſt not then pray, as though we cared not for it, but in the great feeling of our need; ſo ſhall wee eſteeme of all things, when God ſhall heare our prayers, as we ought.</p>

So

               <p>And truly if we could come to pray thus,<note place="margin">If we did thus pray, we ſhuld ſee how God would heare vs.</note> not onely in the feeling of our great wants, but alſo in the conſcience of our great vnworthines, and ſo acknowledge in reſpect of both, how much wee ſhould be beholding to God for any thing: then we ſhould ſee a great deale more than we doe, how hee would heare our prayers. For as a man when he is ſued vnto, if he heareth vs confeſſe, that if hee will grant vs our requeſt, we and all ours ſhall be beholding to him as long as we liue; this is a thing that will greatly mooue him. So the Lord, when he ſeeth that we eſteeme the hearing of our prayers, to be ſo great a benefit, as it is; then is he readie to heare vs: for hee will haue vs ſee how much wee are beholding to him for that that we receiue. We pray now that God would ſtay this heauie hand of the peſtilence, and that he would proceed no further in iudgement againſt vs: but to our prayers we muſt adde, <hi>Selah,</hi> that is, wee muſt ſtirre vp our affections ſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, as that wee profeſſe it to bee an ineſtimable benefit,<note place="margin">And namely for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of this mortal plague.</note> if this way he ſhall ſhew that hee hath heard our prayers.

Thus muſt wee doe alſo for all other things that we pray for, if we will be heard.

                  <note place="margin">Few me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue theſe affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: or in deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring others to pray for them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1.</note>We haue prayed vnto God for many things, but haue wee done it with that acknowledging, that we ſhould be ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beholding to God, if he heare vs? Haue we added <hi>Selah?</hi> that is, haue wee thus ſtirred vp our affections? and did wee then determine to be thankful to God for ſuch a mercie? and ſince haue we remembred to be thankful? <hi>I ſpeake the truth in Chriſt, I lie not</hi> (that I might vſe the words of the Apoſtle) that I haue been deſired of many often to pray for them in their ſeuerall troubles; but of very few deſired againe to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the ſame: which ſheweth that though at the firſt it may be they deſired the prayers of others with <hi>Selah,</hi> that is, with great earneſtnes in the feeling of their owne eſtate: yet afterwards they were not ſo much moued with it, as <hi>Dauid</hi> was here, and ſo forgat to bee thankfull themſelues, at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe did not deſire others to be thankfull for them; or not with that feeling that they deſired them to pray for them before. Let vs then I pray you conſider how wee eſteeme of this, that God heareth our prayers at any time. We eſteeme it may be of the things themſelues, that God beſtoweth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs at our prayers, whether it bee health, or wealth, or any thing els; our owne need driueth vs vnto it: but doe we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it to bee ſo great a fauour of God, and confeſſe our ſelues to be ſo vnworthie of it, that wee ſhall be bound to ſerue him, and praiſe him for it? When wee haue it, I beſeech you, doe we enter ſeriouſly into the conſideration of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God, and of our owne vnworthines, to ſay, What a good God is this, that hath dealt ſo gratiouſly with mee?
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7191:79"/> Surely, ſurely, we ſhall finde that few do it, either before they pray, or when they haue done; to ſay, What a thing is this? I that am ſo vilde a wretch, that haue no goodnes in me at all, that haue ſo many waies offended God, that he ſhould not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding heare my prayers; whereas hee might iuſtly haue brought vpon mee that curſe, that is ſpoken off in the Prophet, That as the Lord cried vnto me often in his word,<note place="margin">

Therefore it was needfull for them by this word <hi>Selah,</hi> to bee ſtirred vp; and wee muſt learne thereby to make more account of the hearing of our prayers, than we doe.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe are the words of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people vnto God for their King: and part of the prayer which they made for him; namely, that God would grant him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his hearts deſire, and fulfill all his purpoſes: that is, whatſoeuer his heart did wiſh and deſire, that God would giue, and whatſoeuer hee purpoſed, God would bring to paſſe. As if they had ſaid, O Lord, whatſoeuer he deſireth in his heart, that grant thou: and whatſoeuer he purpoſeth in his minde, that bring thou to paſſe. Now, <hi>Dauid</hi> teaching them thus to pray, we may preſume that he did determine to haue nothing, but good deſires in his heart, and good purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: and the people by the great experience that they had had a long time of his goodnes, did thus iudge of him: elſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could he haue deſired them ſo to pray for him, neither they haue done it in faith. Firſt then as in all other things we muſt approue our ſelues vnto God, from our very heart, which is the chiefeſt thing that he looketh vnto, and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially he requireth of all according as it is written, <hi>My ſonne giue me thy heart:</hi>

Then may wee boldly pray God to fulfill them, and deſire others alſo to doe ſo: and they being ſo perſwaded of vs by good proofe, may ſafely and with a good conſcience thus pray for vs, though they knowe not all our hearts deſires and purpoſes. For God hath promiſed, that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7191:80"/> whatſoeuer wee aske according to his will, he will grant it vnto vs. And al the promiſes that are made vnto prayer, are thus to be vnderſtood and no otherwiſe. As when Chriſt ſaith: <hi>Aske and it ſhall be giuen you, ſeeke and you ſhall finde;</hi>

                  <hi>that will I do:</hi> that is, which is good, and according to Gods will. As it is euident by that which the Apoſtle writeth to the Romanes: <hi>Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our infirmities:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.</note> 
                  <hi>for we know not what to pray as wee ought, but the Spirit it ſelfe maketh request for vs with ſighes, which cannot be expreſſed: But he that ſearcheth the hearts, knoweth what is the meaning of the Spirit,</hi>

                  <hi>for he maketh requeſt for the Saints according to the will of God.</hi> So that when a man prayeth by the inſtinct and motion of the Spirit of God, which directeth him to aske according to his will and word, then he heareth: and ſuch we may boldly deſire others to pray that God would grant.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe it is ſaid in the tenth Pſalme;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord thou hast heard the deſire of the poore: thou prepareſt their hearts: thou bendeſt thine eare thereto.</hi> Where the Prophet confeſſeth to the comfort of the Church, that God is readie to heare the prayers of his poore Saints: but how? when their hearts by Gods ſpirit bee prepared to deſire good things according to Gods will, then hee is readie to bend his eare: and the more that our hearts be thus prepared, the more may we be aſſured of it. <hi>Dauid</hi> here in this Pſalme being priuie to the goodnes of his owne heart, that in ſinceritie and truth hee deſired to pleaſe God, was bold to commend his deſires vnto the people, that they might commend them to God,<note place="margin">And ſuch we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vnto men.</note> that he would grant them. If then we would haue our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers heard, and alſo haue any comfort in the prayers of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for vs; let vs haue no wicked or vngodly deſires, nothing contrarie to the will of God. For ſuch deſires wee can neither our ſelues commend vnto God, nor any other for vs: neither will he fulfill them, if wee ſhould. And here
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7191:81"/> that wee might not wander and goe aſtray in our deſires to our owne hearts, our Sauiour Chriſt hath directed vs in that forme of prayer, which hee taught his Diſciples. In which wee are taught firſt to pray for ſuch things as concerne the glorie of God,<note place="margin">To this end we muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that forme that Chriſt hath taught vs.</note> the aduancement of the kingdome of Chriſt here vpon the earth: and then for all outward things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining vnto this life, and for life it ſelfe, ſo farre foorth as they may ſtand with theſe: and afterwards for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of our ſins, and for power againſt our temptations, that wee be not ouercome. If then wee pray after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, God will heare vs: as it is ſaid in another place; <hi>Seeke yee firſt the kingdom of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. And ſeeke for the direction of his ſpirit to teach vs to pray.</note> 
                  <hi>and his righteouſneſſe, and all theſe things ſhall be ministred vnto you.</hi> Therefore it is agreeable vnto Gods will to pray firſt for heauenly things, and then for earthly; and ſuch prayers God will heare. And yet though wee haue this forme as a direction to guide vs in our prayers; many times we may be ſo diſtracted, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſome temptation, that we ſhall not know what to aske aright,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.</note> as the Apoſtle ſaith: then Gods ſpirit in thoſe that be his, helpeth their infirmitie herein, and ſtirreth vp in them at the leaſt ſighes and groanes, that cannot be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: which being of the ſpirit of God, and ſo alſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods will, hee heareth and granteth the meaning of them. Therefore for our further direction we muſt pray to God for the aſſiſtance of his holy ſpirit in prayer, that it may moderate all our deſires, and teach vs thus to pray ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God, that ſo hee may grant accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our heart, and fulfill all our purpoſes, as it is ſaid here.</p>
               <p>Thus did our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe pray, who when hee was in ſuch great agonies, that hee ſaid,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>My ſoule is very heauie euen vnto the death,</hi> he prayed vnto God, and ſaid, <hi>O father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſſe from me;</hi> and this hee did three times: but in the end hee ſaid,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 42.</note> 
                  <hi>O my father, if this cup cannot paſſe away from mee, but that I mu t drinke it, thy will be done:</hi> and ſo God heard him, as the Apoſtle ſaith;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7.</note> 
                  <hi>That in the daies of his fleſh he did offer
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7191:81"/> vp prayers and ſupplications, with ſtrong crying and teares, vnto him that was able to ſaue him from death, and was alſo heard in that which hee feared.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.43. Chriſt in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſubmitting his will to Gods will, was heard.</note> 
                  <hi>For there appeared an Angell vnto him from heauen, comforting him.</hi> Thus his hearts deſire (as at all other times, ſo in this diſtreſſe of his) being according to the will of God, he did grant it. So look to al the prayers of Gods ſeruants in the old and new Teſtament, and we ſhall ſee, that when they haue ſubmitted their wils to Gods will, then he hath granted their deſires. Now the will of God is, that we ſhould abſolutely &amp; firſt of all deſire thoſe things, that might make for his glorie, &amp; the ſaluation of our ſelues and of our brethren: but al outward things ſo farre foorth, as they may ſtand with theſe, and further them: and ſo farre will God graunt them. <hi>Iacob</hi> when hee went to <hi>Laban,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his prayer in the way after this manner:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20. The will of God is that we preferre hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly things before earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> Deſiring God that he would be with him, and keepe him in that iourney which he went, and giue him bread to eate, and cloathes to put on; ſo that hee might come againe to his fathers houſe in ſafetie; and in a word, That he would be his God; for ſo doe the beſt interpreters reade this text. So that this he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired principally, though it be laſt named, That God would be his good God, and continue his couenant of fauour with him, to forgiue him his ſinnes, to increaſe in him all graces needfull for his ſaluation, &amp;c: and to ſhew his fauour this way in protecting him in his iourney, though it were but in giuing him things neceſſarie, as meate, and drinke, and cloathing. Now becauſe his prayer was thus agreeable to the will of God, that he firſt deſired the continuance of his fauour, and then all things needfull for this life, ſo farre as it might ſtand with that, God heard him; and hee confeſſeth it afterwards in his returne, that the bleſſing of God had been greatly vpon him, when he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 32.10. And he hath heard his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, that haue thus prayed.</note> 
                  <hi>I am vnworthie of the least of all the mercies and all the truth, which thou hast ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vnto thy ſeruant: for with my ſtaffe came I ouer this Iordan, and now haue I gotten two bandes.</hi> The like may bee ſaid of the prayer of King <hi>Salomon;</hi> That when <hi>in Gibeon

                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 3.5.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſayd, Aske what I ſhall giue thee:</hi> and hee prayed thus Giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy ſeruant an vnderſtanding heart, to iudge thy people, that I may diſcerne betweene good and euill. So that hee asked wiſdome that hee might bee fit to ſerue God in his calling. This did ſo pleaſe the Lord, that he gaue him this anſwere:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe thou hast asked this thnig<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hast not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for thy ſelfe long life, nor riches, nor the life of thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, but hast asked for thy ſelfe vnderstanding to heare iudgement: Beholde, I haue done according to thy words: loe, I haue giuen thee a wiſe and an vnderstanding heart, ſo that there hath been none like thee before thee, neither after thee ſhall ariſe the like vnto thee. And I haue alſo giuen thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches and honour, ſo that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Kings there ſhall bee none like vnto thee all thy dayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This muſt teach vs all to knowe the will of God, that it might direct vs in all things, euen in our prayers; that wee doe not raſhly hand ouer head, aske wee cannot tell what. Let vs aske that that may further vs in our ſaluation, as the forgiuenes of our ſinnes,<note place="margin">Thus muſt we pray in this time of the plague, that all men may profit by it.</note> repentance for them, ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, faith in Gods promiſes, the feeling of his loue, and all thoſe things that appertaine to the glory of God; and thoſe we are ſure are according to his will; and if wee did aske theſe more, we ſhould receiue more. But all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, as long life, health and wealth, let vs deſire in the ſecond place, both with leſſe deſire, and with mindes contented to want them, if it bee not Gods will to giue them: and ſo farre wee may bee aſſured that he will heare vs. And namely for this viſitation of the Plague let vs thus pray; that all might profit by it to repentance and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life, for to that end we are aſſured that it is ſent. For as the Apoſtle ſaith to the Corinthians when there was great ſicknes among them, ſo that many alſo dyed; <hi>For this cauſe</hi> (meaning ſinne,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30.</note> whereof he named one that was common among them) <hi>many are weake and ſicke among

So that if either wee had not ſinned before, or hauing ſinned we had repented vs in time, and iudged our ſelues, God would not thus grieuouſly haue entred into iudgement with vs. For as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, he <hi>is full of compaſſion and mercy, ſlowe to anger,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 103.8.</note> 
                  <hi>and of great kindnes:</hi> and <hi>will not alway chide, nor keepe his anger for euer,</hi> though wee offend him continually. For if hee ſhould ſtraitly marke our iniquities,<note place="margin">

But hee deferreth his puniſhments often, to ſee if men will repent them in time; and in deede hee giueth all men ſufficient time for that, and calleth them to it daily: as he did the olde world before the flood, by the preaching of <hi>Noah,</hi>

                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3.</note> giuing them an hundred and twentie yeeres to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in: and ſo did hee to the wicked Sodomites by the Miniſtery of righteous <hi>Lot,</hi> before they were conſumed with fire and brimſtone from heauen: and ſo did he to the Iſraelites, and to the Iewes by all his Prophets, before they were carried away into captiuitie: and ſo hath he this long time and often forewarned vs of his iudgements, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vs earneſtly vnto repentance by the miniſtery of all his faithfull ſeruants in our time, before this plague came vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs. So that wee cannot ſay, as the diuell did falſely chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge Chriſt in the Goſpell;<note place="margin">

               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:7191:83"/>
               <p>And wee may ſafely pray for thoſe that are vnder this viſitation, that God would giue them patience and ſtrength to beare whatſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe God to lay vpon them: for this alſo is according to his will, as the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>God is faithfull,</hi>

And thus farre alſo wee our ſelues may bee aſſured, that wee haue our part in all the prayers of our brethren this day, and at all times; as wee doe deſire to profit by this hand of God, and to haue patience to doe his will in this, and all other croſſes of his. But as for the remouing of it,<note place="margin">And how farre for the remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of it.</note> wee may and ought to pray, that it may bee in his good time, when it is his holy will, and as it ſhall pleaſe him, ſo it may bee: and that wee might bee willing to waite vpon his leaſure, and preſcribe no time vnto him, nor any meaſure of his dealing, but that his will may bee done, and not ours: as our Sauiour Chriſt prayed in his greateſt agony, <hi>Father, not my will, but thine be done:</hi> then will hee heare vs as hee did him.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7191:83"/> prayeth with him and for him, <hi>Thy will bee done.</hi> So that if his will bee agreeable to Gods will as it ought, then all good men and women pray for him continually in all his troubles, both of body and minde. And truly this is and may bee a great comfort for vs at all times, and in all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, that in what eſtate ſo euer wee bee, night and day, if wee pray vnto God, if wee can bring our hearts to this, that the deſire of them bee according to his will: and though wee would faine haue this and that, yet euermore with this condition and no otherwiſe, if it bee his bleſſed will; and wee ſubmit all our deſires to his holy will, and bee contented, that not ſo much our wils, as his might take place: then the whole Church euery where prayeth for vs, and will doe: as they did heere for <hi>Dauid:</hi> and ſo wee neede not doubt but God will heare vs and them in his good time, that ſo wee might waite patientlie vpon him.</p>
               <p>But many men haue ſuch wicked and vngodly deſires,<note place="margin">Many mens deſires are ſo wicked, that they are not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to God or men.</note> and the purpoſes of their heart are ſo bad, as they dare not commend them vnto God, but hide them from him as much as they can. And though ſome do ignorantly &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly pray to God to fulfill their fooliſh and ſinfull deſires; yet none can pray for them, neither haue they part in the praiers of the Church, and ſo God heareth them not. And this is that which the Apoſtle ſaith to the Iewes, <hi>Yee aske, and receiue not, becauſe yee aske amiſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.3.</note> 
                  <hi>that yee might lay the ſame out on your pleaſures.</hi> Where hee ſaith, that becauſe they did aske worldly things, firſt with an vnſatiable mind, and then to a wrong end, euen to conſume them vpon their owne luſts, and not that they might glorifie God in doing good, and ſo it was not according to Gods will: therefore they had them not; for ſuch deſires of the heart God will not graunt. They that are couetous, they haue ſuch deſires in their hearts for the world, that neither themſelues,<note place="margin">As the deſires of couetous men. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9.</note> nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for them can pray, that God would graunt them, and giue them according to their heart. <hi>For they that will be rich,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7191:84"/> fall into temptation and ſnares, and into many fooliſh and noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome luſts, which drowne men in perdition and deſtruction: for the deſire of money is the roote of all euill, which while ſome lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted after, they erred from the faith, and pearced themſelues through with many ſorrowes.</hi> This is a wonderfull, yet a true ſaying; For if euery couetous man might haue according to his deſire; what ſhould become of all the world? al ſhould be little enough for themſelues. Nay what ſhould become of themſelues? they would aske that that ſhould be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them. As it is written of one, that hee deſired that all that hee touched might be gold, and it was granted vnto him: and by this meanes hee ſoone ſtarued for want of meate and drinke: for not onely his cuppes and diſhes at his touching were turned into gold, but euen the meate and drinke that was in them: and ſo could neither eate nor drinke any thing: and thus his deſire through couetouſnes was not onely fooliſh, but alſo noiſome and hurtfull, as the Apoſtle ſaid, whereby hee was drowned in perdition and deſtruction. Which though it bee but a meere fable, and poeticall fiction, yet it doth ſhew the truth of this that wee ſpeake of: namely, that couetous mens deſires many of them are ſuch, that they are not to bee deſired of God. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men their hearts are ſo full of hatred and malice,<note place="margin">And of the malitious.</note> that all their deſires for the moſt part tend to the hurt of others, and to the good of few, eſpecially they deſire the hurt of thoſe whom they account their enemies: if they might haue their deſire (I ſpeake not of the Papiſts onely, for then none of vs ſhould be aliue) but of ſome other that profeſſe the Goſpell, many of their neighbours ſhould bee a great deale worſe than they are.

And we our ſelues muſt looke to our deſires, leaſt we be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of the benefit of the praier of others: For as if our hearts be ſound &amp; vpright with God, and we deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but according to the will of God, then all pray for vs, &amp; euery where by vertue of the communion of Saints we inioy the fruit of the prayer of the Saints; ſo if our hearts be turned from God by our crooked wayes,<note place="margin">

And we had need to be put in mind of this doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe for the moſt part our minds are more ſet vpon earthly things, than vpon heauenly, &amp; we are more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to lay vp our treaſures here on earth, than in heauen, where the true treaſure is: and ſo becauſe where the treaſure is, there will the heart be alſo, as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt ſaith in the Goſpell,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 6.20.21.

               </p>
               <p>If then at any time we haue asked any thing at the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7191:85"/> hand of God, and haue not receiued it,<note place="margin">If we aske, and haue not, let vs examine, and correct our deſires. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9.</note> let vs conſider what it is, and how we haue asked it: if it be any thing that is euill, as the deſtruction of our enemies, the curſe of God vpon our neighbours, whereas we ſhould rather bleſſe them, as the Apoſtle ſaith, knowing that we are called to be heires of the bleſsing of God; then no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, if God do not giue vs our deſires. Or if it be a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing, yet we deſire it not lawfully, that is, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods will; as for example, If we deſire earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things aboue heauenly, as moſt doe: or as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this viſitation of the plague, if we more deſire that it might be taken away, than that we our ſelues and others might profit by it: &amp; generally, if we more deſire health and wealth, eſtimation and worldly proſperitie, than faith and repentance and the true feare of God, and ſuch like; then theſe deſires of our hearts no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile if God graunt not. Or againe, if we deſire not theſe outward things, ſo that we can be contented to want them, if it be not Gods will to giue them; and to ſay with the Apoſtle, I can be abaſed, and I can abound,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.12.</note> eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where and in all things I am inſtructed both to be full, and to be hungry, and to abound and to haue want; and what ſtate ſoeuer I am in, therewith to be content. For otherwiſe neither can we pray our ſelues,<note place="margin">How we ſhold pray concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this plague, if we will be heard.</note> nor other for vs, That God would giue vs according to our heart; becauſe the deſires of the ſame are not faſhioned accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his will. Therefore both for the remouing of this plague, and for all other things we muſt be of that mind that <hi>Dauid</hi> was, when by the conſpiring of his ſonne <hi>Abſalom</hi> he was driuen out of Ieruſalem: who ſaid,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.25.</note> Carie the Arke again into the citie; if I ſhall find fauor in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me againe, and ſhew me both it, and the tabernacle thereof: But if he ſay thus, I haue no delight in thee; behold here I am, let him doe to me as ſeemeth good in his eyes. Thus he reſigned both his kingdome and life into Gods hands, to haue
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:7191:86"/> them or looſe them according to his will; and then he receiued againe of God both the one and the other: for <hi>Abſolon</hi> was deſtroyed, and he ſafely returned into Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem. So ſhould we now much more receiue life and health in this great mortalitie, if we did pray for them with theſe minds,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17, 19.</note> that as <hi>Abraham</hi> was willing to offer vp his ſonne <hi>Izaack</hi> vnto God, and then he reſtored him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life as it were againe, ſo we be willing to haue all, if it be Gods will, then will he reſtore all things vnto vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Therefore if God giue vs not that which we ask, let vs thus profit, to the examining and conuerting of our deſires.</p>
               <p>But to conclude for this time, whereas all men gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deſire, that they might haue their heart ſatisfied, and that whatſoeuer they haue a mind to, they might haue it: and this all ſorts couet and ſeek after, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſteth great contentation and quietneſſe of mind, That we haue our deſires in all things: let vs nouriſh in vs continually none but good deſires, for thoſe God wil fulfill.<note place="margin">The comfort of thoſe that haue good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: and the vexation of them that haue euill.</note> But if we haue wicked and vngodly deſires in our mind, as the Lord will not fulfill them, ſo this ſhall be no ſmall croſſe vnto vs, that we are abridged of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. So that all they that ſo liue, that they make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience euen of their deſires, and labour to keepe them within the compaſſe of Gods word and will, their life is moſt pleaſant and comfortable, &amp; full of contentment, for they ſhall ſooneſt haue the deſires of their heart from time to time. But if we giue ſcope to our affections, and ſuffer our deſires to range beyond the bounds of Gods word and will, as therein we diſpleaſe him, that they are ſo vnruly; ſo we ſhall not be quiet, for God will croſſe them, and not ſuffer vs to proſper in our wicked deſires. For though the wicked many times doe ſo, for their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condemnation, who often haue more than their hearts deſire: yet this is the ordinarie portion of Gods children, that if their deſires be good, God will fulfill
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7191:86"/> them: as theſe of <hi>Dauids</hi> were, and therefore God did ſo vnto him, as he confeſſeth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.2.</note> Thou haſt giuen him his harts deſire. But if they be euill, he will keepe them from them: and we are to pray, that he would doe ſo, to that end, that we might ſeeke to purge our hearts from all ſuch ſinfull deſires. And God graunt, that we may thus profit by the not hauing of our deſires, to examine them whether they be good or ill, and to amend whatſoeuer is amiſſe: and ſo ſhall it be more profitable for vs, to be hindered in ſuch deſires, than to haue them fulfilled. But we ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeake more of this the next day: in the meane time let this be ſufficient.</p>

From whence we learne, what is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of true prayer; euen that it is an inward deſire of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7191:87"/> the heart vnto God for ſome thing: which he, that is the onely ſearcher of the heart, knoweth, and ſo is able to ſatisfie. VVhich is ſo to be vnderſtood, not that we ſhould vſe no words at all in prayer, for they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times neceſſarie; as not only when many pray together, that one ſhould ſpeake out aloud, that the reſt might heare and ſay Amen: but euen many times when we pray alone by our ſelues, that by our ſpeech our minds might be ſtirred vp, and alſo kept vpon that that wee ſpeake. But euen then, the ſubſtance of our prayer is in the deſire of the heart, and our words are but ſignes to teſtifie and declare the ſame:<note place="margin">Though words be vſed, yet the deſire of the hart is the chiefeſt.</note> ſo that there can be no true prayer at all without the deſire of the heart, but there may be very effectuall prayer without words: and when in prayer both doth concurre, words, and deſires; God reſpecteth this later more than the former, and the deſires of our hearts doe crie lowder in the eares of the Lord of hoaſts, than all the words that we can vſe, be they neuer ſo many and ſo vehement. And though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires without words are effectuall, yet words without the deſire of the heart is nothing worth: and therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> though he vſed both, yet here nameth this onely: and after, when he giueth thankes to God for hearing of his prayers, though hee nameth both, yet hee placeth this firſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.2.</note> as the chiefe, ſaying, <hi>Thou haſt giuen him his hearts deſire, and haſt not denied him the request of his lips.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we pray, let vs prepare our hearts, that they may be full of holy deſires: and in prayer let vs hold out in them, and not ſuffer them to fall; for when they decay and die, then doe we ceaſe praying, though our lips mooue ſtill neuer ſo faſt. And ſo all they that pray in a ſtrange tongue, and know not what they ſay (as is the manner of the Papiſts) and ſo cannot poſsibly haue any deſire in their heart of that that they ſpeake, doe not pray at all. And therefore though they boaſt great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of prayer, and ſay, that they did continually pray, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7191:87"/> they had their beads about them,<note place="margin">Without which, words are not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> and their lips were going; yet in truth there was not, neither could there be any prayer at all among them. And beſides all they in our daies, who in the time of prayer haue their minds otherwiſe occupied, than about that that is pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for; though they kneele downe, lift vp their eyes and hands, and ſay Amen with the reſt; do not pray one whit, but are as farre from praying as can be, though they ſeeme vnto others to pray very deuoutly. Therefore when we come hether to the houſe of prayer, to pray together, and one of vs for another, they, and they only, haue the benefit of common prayer, who haue their minds attent vpon that that is ſaid, and deſire from their heart the ſame thing with the reſt. For here we pray to God, that he would giue to euery one according to his deſire: if then either they be aſleepe, or talking, or ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing about, or otherwiſe buſie; then we pray that God would giue them nothing, for they deſire nothing. And hereunto agreeth that, which the virgine <hi>Marie</hi> ſaith in her ſong, <hi>He hath filled the hungry with good things,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.53.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſent away the rich emptie.</hi> VVhere ſhe confeſſeth, that thoſe who deſire good things of God earneſtly, as the hungry and thirſtie deſire meat and drinke, thoſe he filleth, and beſtoweth plentifully vpon them vnto their content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but they that are rich, and full as it were in their owne opinion, and ſo deſire nothing of God as they ſhould, they receiue nothing, but are ſent away as emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as they come.</p>
               <p>And this is ſo certaine, that in prayer God looketh into the heart wholly, that it that be mooued to deſire earneſtly, though we ſpeake not a word, it is ſufficient, he knoweth well ynough what we pray for, and will graunt it as ſoone, as though we had vſed all the words that might be to perſuade. For thus it is ſaid of <hi>Hannah,</hi> when ſhe prayed in the temple, becauſe ſhe was barren: She ſpake in her heart, her lips did mooue only,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.13.</note> but her
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7191:88"/> voice was not heard: and when <hi>Hely</hi> thought that ſhe had beene drunken, becauſe he ſaw her lips mooue, but heard no voice,<note place="margin">God heareth the deſire of the heart, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there are no wordes.</note> and told her of it, ſaying, <hi>How long wilt thou be drunken:</hi> ſhe anſwered, and ſaid, <hi>Nay my lord, but I am a woman troubled in ſpirit, and haue poured out my ſoule before the Lord.</hi> Then he praied vnto God for her, that he would graunt her this petition that ſhe had made in her heart without words: and the Lord did ſo, and gaue her a manchild, which ſhe prayed for, as her ſelfe doth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards confeſſe. Thus we ſee, that God heareth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the heart, when there are no words; as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, he careth not for all the words that can be vſed without this deſire. After this manner alſo did <hi>Nehemiah</hi> pray, and was heard: for when he was waiting at the Kings table (for he was his butler) by reaſon of the ill newes which he heard of the Church of God a little before, it was perceiued that his countenance was more ſad than it was wont to be in former times, and the king asked him the cauſe of it, ſeeing that he was not ſicke, and ſaid, certainely it was nothing elſe but ſorrow of heart.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2.1.</note> Then <hi>Nehemiah</hi> told him the cauſe of it; and the king moſt gratiouſly bad him require what he would: and ſo he deſired of him, as it is ſet downe there. But firſt of all it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Verſe 4.</note> That he prayed to the God of heauen: which muſt needs be thus vnderſtood, that he did ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lift vp his mind vnto God, according as the time and place did then require, and deſired him to bleſſe him, and to mooue the heart of the king to be fauourable towards him; for it was not fit for him then to haue kneeled downe, and to haue ſpoken aloud, and ſo haue made a long prayer, when the king was at meat: and ſo he offered vp the deſire of his heart vnto God, though he ſpake nothing, and God graunted it. And this is ſo vndoubtedly true, that God in prayer looketh to the deſire of the heart,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.</note> that it is ſaid, <hi>That when we know not what to pray, as we ought, the spirit of God it ſelfe maketh requeſt

                     <hi>Ephe.</hi> 6.18.</note> 
                  <hi>Pray alwaies with all manner prayer and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the spirit; and watch thereunto with all perſeuerance and ſupplication:</hi> ſo that what kind of prayer ſoeuer wee vſe (as he ſpeaketh of all manner prayer) whether long or ſhort, with words or without, publicke or priuat, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone or with others, it muſt alwaies be in the ſpirit, and from the heart; and that it might be ſo, he giueth vs counſell to watch thereunto, that is, to haue an eye to our heart, and to ſet a watch vpon the affections of our mind, and ſuffer them not to bee carried away: and this we had need to doe carefully, becauſe elſe they will too ſoone wander ſuddenly before we be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, as all of vs doe find it to be true by too great experience.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that prayer is a worke of the heart, and of the ſpirit (as we haue heard) and not of the lips and of the tongue ſo much; euery one that commeth vnto prayer, muſt eſpecially labour in this one point, that he may bring his heart vnto God, and not to ſtand ſo much vpon words.<note place="margin">If we haue good deſires, the want of fit wordes muſt not hinder vs from prayer.</note> And this muſt be no barre vnto any to keep them from prayer, to ſay, I haue no fit words, I cannot vtter my mind well, I haue a good heart, but my ſpeech is naught, &amp;c. For firſt of all, if we be ſufficiently tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the feeling of our wants, we ſhall haue words inough to vtter the ſame: for all experience ſheweth, that euery one can complaine well inough to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of men, of any thing wherein they are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, be they neuer ſo ſimple: as the pooreſt creature
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:7191:89"/> that is, that is pinched with hunger and thurſt, can aske bread and meat, and no man need to inſtruct him what words he ſhould vſe in ſuch a caſe: and if any be oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſufficiently lay ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their wrongs, we ſee that young children can doe that, and almoſt naturall fooles. Then aſſuredly if we had that inward ſight and feeling of our ſinnes, and of the want of the graces of Gods ſpirit, that we ſhould haue, we ſhould haue wordes inough to vtter the ſame vnto God, and to poure out our whole mind vnto him, and to ſay, Good Lord giue me this, and giue me that. Therefore let vs firſt labour for that, and then the other will ſoone follow, that is, let vs haue the feeling of our own wants, and we ſhall want no wordes in prayer. But ſay, that wee want words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: it maketh no matter one whit, God looketh not to that, but to the deſire of the heart: &amp; he heareth that ſooner than the other,<note place="margin">For God loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to the heart.</note> nay without the other. <hi>Hannah</hi> ſayd nothing, ſpake not a word with her lips, no more did <hi>Nehemiah</hi> (as we heard euen now) but they both prayed in the ſpirit, and powred out their ſoules before the Lord: and God heard them. Therefore if we could ſay nothing at all, nor ſpeake one word, yet if we doe but ſigh and grone in our hearts, that ſhall be as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto God, as all the well ordered words in the world. King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> when hee was ſicke vnto death, prayed moſt earneſtly vnto God for life, and he added fifteene yeares vnto it: but how prayed he then? and what were his words? he ſpeaketh thus of it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,<note place="margin">

Let vs pray for our brethren that are viſited with the peſtilence, that God would giue them their hearts deſire, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7191:89"/> that he would put into their minds good and holy deſires: and according to thoſe, when they ſhall be ſo weake, euen at the point of death, &amp; all the powers of the bodie ſhall faile them, that he would deale with them in mercy, either for comfort, or for deliuerance, or for both. And ſo muſt we labour with our own hearts, that not onely they be free from ill deſires, but that they may not be emptie and barren of good; that others may pray for vs, Giue them according to their heart; and we may haue the fruit of their prayers, when our deſires ſhall be good, and euen then when we ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſpeake a word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Giue thee according to thy heart,</hi> Thus he willeth them to pray for him. But what was he? he was a king,<note place="margin">It ſeemeth that all kings may ſoone haue their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and ſo need not pray to God to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill them.</note> and a mightie prince, therefore if any might haue their hearts deſire, then he moſt of all. For what can a king deſire, but he ſhall haue it? if it may be bought for money, if it may be gotten by ſea or by land, if it may be compaſſed by the wit &amp; ſtrength of men. They can deſire nothing, but there are ynow that will procure it for them: if they be kings and princes, all at their commaund, and are glad to pleaſe them with their deſires in all things: what needed he then to be ſo carefull for this, that he might haue according to his hearts deſire, and that they ſhould pray ſo earneſtly for it? was there any need of it? was there any feare of it? if he had bene a meane man, it had bin another matter; or one that could not haue holpen himſelfe, nor had had any to doe for him: but all ſeeke to ſatisfie the deſires of kings, if it be with the hazard of their owne liues. <hi>Dauid</hi> had experience of this himſelfe, who when he was in an hold, and the gariſon of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims was then in Bethlehem, he longed, &amp; ſaid,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Oh that one would giue me to drinke of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate.</hi> Then three mighty men brake into the hoſt of the Philiſtims, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, and brought it to <hi>Dauid;</hi> who would not
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7191:90"/> drinke thereof, but powred it out for an offering before the Lord, and ſayd, <hi>O Lord be it farre from me, that I ſhould doe this: is not this the blood of the men that went in ieopardie of their liues:</hi> therefore he would not drinke it. Thus though he repented him of this raſh and fooliſh deſire, yet we ſee how ſoone he had his deſire, and how ready his men were to ſatisfie it, euen in a very hard thing, and wherein they did hazard their liues for him. Hauing then ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worthy Captaines as he had, what might not he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that they would doe for him? and ſo why needed he to doubt of any of his deſires? The like may be ſayd of <hi>Ahab</hi> the king of Iſrael, when he deſired the vineyard of <hi>Naboth,</hi> and could not get it at the firſt, whereupon he was greatly diſpleaſed, and laid himſelfe vpon his bed, and would not eat: How ſoone was there a way deuiſed for him by his wife <hi>Ieſabell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 21.4.</note> to ſatisfie his deſires, though it was vnlawfull? And firſt of all ſhe comforteth him ouer it,<note place="margin">Verſe 7.</note> and ſayd, <hi>Doest thou now gouerne the kingdome of Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> as if ſhe had ſayd, what, I perceiue thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not who thou art? <hi>Thou art a King, thou mayeſt haue what thou wilt, one way or other, by might or by wrong, thou nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt but deſire and haue. Vp, eat bread, and be of good cheere, I will giue thee the vineyard of Naboth, &amp;c.</hi> And then ſhe wrote let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that he might be accuſed &amp; condemned of treaſon, that ſo it might fall to the king by law, as it did, and as it followeth in that ſtorie. But this is that which principally for our purpoſe is to be obſerued, that ſhe was of this mind, That a king might haue whatſoeuer he deſired. And ſo many fooliſh people thinke that kings,<note place="margin">And ſo doe many world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings thinke of themſelues, and of others.</note> &amp; noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp; rich men, &amp; thoſe that haue wealth inough, they may haue all things after their harts deſire, &amp; ſo haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to croſſe them in their deſires: ſo that if they were in their caſe, they would liue at their hearts eaſe, for look whatſoeuer they deſired, they would haue, &amp; who ſhold hinder them from it? and ſo they would ſet their heart at reſt, and liue as merrily as the day is long and broad;
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7191:90"/> and they maruell why others ſhould not do ſo, and that they ſhould at any time complaine, that they haue not their deſire.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 12 16.</note> VVherein they are like vnto that Epicure that is ſpoken of in the Goſpell; whoſe ground, when it brought forth fruit ſo plenteouſly, that he could not tell where to lay it, vntill he bethought himſelfe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his barnes, and then he ſaid to himſelfe: <hi>Soule, thou hast much goods laid vp for many yeares, liue at eaſe, eat, drinke, and take thy pastime:</hi> ſo that he thought, becauſe he had wealth ynough, that he might haue his hearts deſire in all things, and be beholding to none but to himſelfe for it, no not vnto God, for he ſpeakes as one that neuer thought of him. But the Lord did diſappoint him of it, and ſaid, <hi>O foole,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſe 20.</note> 
                  <hi>this night will they fetch away thy ſoule from thee, then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be which thou hast prouided.</hi> And thus will he ſay and doe to all ſuch fooliſh world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings or worldly fooles. For it is added, <hi>So is he that gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth riches, and is not rich in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Dauid</hi> here ſheweth, that he was of another mind: for though his deſires were neuer ſo good and lawfull in this action, and he had neuer ſo many means to accompliſh them (as indeed for his deſire in warre he had as many as could almoſt be deſired; for he had many worthie captaines,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.18.</note> and we read not of any the like, as their courage and great valour is ſet downe in the Scripture) yet he beleeued, and would haue his ſubiects to beleeue alſo, that neither himſelfe nor they for him could accompliſh his deſires, but as God ſhould graunt them; and therefore he willed them to pray to God, that he would ſo doe, ſaying, <hi>Graunt thee according to thine heart.</hi> This then is that,<note place="margin">But only God giueth to all men their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</note> that from hence we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that it is God onely, that doth and muſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the deſires of all men and women, and none is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of themſelues to doe it, be they neuer ſo great and mightie, nor any other for them. And this is the firſt article of our faith, <hi>That we beleeue in God the father al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7191:91"/> maker of heauen and earth;</hi> that is, that he made all things of nothing, and doth ſtill bring al things to paſſe: and therefore as nothing is done without him, ſo he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth all things,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135.6.</note> as it is ſaid in the Pſalme: <hi>He hath done whatſoeuer he would, in heauen, and in the earth, and in all the deepes.</hi> So that whatſoeuer good any hath deſired in time paſt, if they haue obtained it, they muſt confeſſe to the glorie of God, that it was not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, or any other for them, but God alone, that gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their hearts deſire. For though they had theſe meanes,<note place="margin">And this we muſt confeſſe in all things that we haue receiued.</note> yet God could haue hindered them all, that they ſhould haue done them no good. And therefore that which <hi>Moſes</hi> forewarned the people of Iſrael of, when they ſhould come into the land of Canaan, That they ſhould take heed that they did not aſcribe any to themſelues, but all vnto God, who was the only giuer of the ſame; is true of all other things,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.17.</note> when he ſaith thus vnto them: <hi>Beware leaſt thou ſay in thine heart, my power, and the strength of mine owne hand hath prepared me this abundance: but remember the Lord thy God, for it is he that giueth thee power to get ſubſtance to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh his couenant, which he ſware vnto thy father, as appeareth this day.</hi> VVhere he forbiddeth them not onely proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to boaſt of themſelues, but not ſo much as to ſuffer it once to enter into their thoughts: <hi>Say not in thine heart, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus did <hi>Dauid</hi> confeſſe of himſelfe, that God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him his deſire: &amp; in that Pſalme that he maketh of thanksgiuing for the victorie, he teacheth the people to praiſe God for it, vnder this title, That God had brought to paſſe his deſires: and that he ſaw his deſire vpon his enemies, he aſcribeth it neither to himſelfe, nor to his worthie captaines,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.2.</note> but to the Lord, ſaying, <hi>Thou hast giuen him his hearts deſire.</hi> As if he had ſaid, O Lord, I deſired ſuch and ſuch things in my heart, but I could not procure them to my ſelfe, therefore I prayed vnto thee for them, and I deſired others alſo ſo to doe; and thou haſt giuen
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7191:91"/> vs the thing that wee deſired, and therefore wee giue thankes vnto thee for it. And this is that alſo, which the Pſalmiſt ſaith of the Iſraelites, whileſt they were in the wilderneſſe: they longed for fleſh, but they could not ſatisfie their owne deſires, though they were neuer ſo many; but the Lord he ſent them meat ynough, and ſo did ſatisfie their deſires, <hi>He rained fleſh vpon them, as duſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.27.</note> 
                  <hi>and feathered foule, as the ſand of the ſea: and he made it fall in the middest of their campe, euen round about their habitations: ſo they did eat, and were well filled, for he gaue them their deſire.</hi> So muſt we all ſay of our ſelues, for all things that we deſire and haue, euen our meat and drinke,<note place="margin">Euen in our meat &amp; drink, wherewith we are ſatisfied.</note> that it is God that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs our deſire. For when as many in the world doe want, and are pinched with hunger, and doe eat and drinke by meaſure and by weight, becauſe they haue not ynough; when as in the meane ſeaſon we eat and drinke of the beſt, and are well filled: muſt we not needs confeſſe to the praiſe of God, that he hath giuen vs our deſire? For many haue as great deſires to theſe things, and yet are in extreame want, and ſo might wee haue beene too, but that God hath prouided better for vs, and giuen vs our deſires, and denied them vnto others. Beſides, ſome that haue much, haue not the heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it vpon themſelues, and ſo they deſire, &amp; haue not: and this is one of the vanities of the world that <hi>Salomon</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaineth of, <hi>There is one alone, and there is not a ſecond,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccle.</hi> 4.8.</note> 
                  <hi>which hath neither ſonne nor brother, yet is there none end of his trauaile, neither can his eye be ſatisfied with riches: neither doth he think, For whom doe I trauaile, and defraud my ſelfe of pleaſure? this alſo is vanitie, and this an euill trauaile.</hi> Therfore he ſaith, that this is all that a man can haue of all that he poſſeſſeth,<note place="margin">chap. 2.24.</note> 
                  <hi>To eat and drinke, and to take his part of them:</hi> and yet to doe ſo, is the ſpeciall gift of God, &amp; all haue it not. And to conclude, thus doth the Prophet confeſſe of others, &amp; of himſelfe: <hi>Lord thou haſt heard the deſire of the poore:</hi> where,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17.</note> by poore he meaneth the humble and lowly, and ſo alſo doe ſome
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7191:92"/> tranſlate it, that is, thoſe that are afflicted and humbled that way: ſo that all men, rich and poore, muſt confeſſe, that it is God that muſt giue them all their deſires. And therefore whether we deſire health or wealth, long life, or any thing els; or we deſire an end of this grieuous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie of the peſtilence,<note place="margin">And in taking away of this plague.</note> and that the places where it is, might at the laſt be ſet free from it, and that all places might haue their accuſtomed health, to the comfort of vs all: God alone is he that muſt giue theſe things, or els we ſhall neuer haue our deſires.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">We muſt ſhew this faith in praying to God to fulfill our deſires.</note>This doctrine though it be ſo euident and cleare, as it is, yet few do rightly beleeue it: for if they did, then they would doe as <hi>Dauid</hi> did here in the like caſe, that is, they would in all things pray to God, that he would giue them their deſires. But the moſt part couet and deſire many things, and neuer aske them of God; as though they imagined, that they could haue them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him. So ſaith the Apoſtle, and chargeth the Iewes out it:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iames</hi> 4.2.</note> ſaying, <hi>Ye lust, and haue not, ye enuie and deſire immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratly, and cannot obtaine: ye fight and warre, and get nothing, becauſe ye aske not.</hi> That is, they truſted greatly for theſe worldly things, one for one thing, and another for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they had a world of deſires in their mind, and they enuied alſo others that went beyond them, and had that which they had not, and they did ſtriue and take all the paines that they could to get more; and yet they had not according to their deſire, becauſe they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not thoſe things of God, who onely could fulfill all their deſires. So that if a man beleeueth, that it is God onely, that muſt giue him all his deſires, elſe he ſhall deſire and deſire in vaine, as theſe did; he muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his deſires vnto God in prayer, that he might ſo doe: and the want of prayer in all our deſires, argueth the want of faith in them. All thoſe then that haue their heads occupied about the world, that they haue a multitude of deſires in their mind, to this and to that,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7191:92"/> and to they cannot tell themſelues what; &amp; do not from time to time aske of God, that he would fulfill them, do not rightly beleeue that he onely can doe it: but truſt to their own wit and policie, to their owne ſtrength and power to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, or to ſome other. And yet God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times diſappointeth them of their deſires, when they think themſelues ſureſt of them; that they might by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſee that in themſelues, which they will not heare out of the word: <hi>Yee lust, and haue not, becauſe you aske not.</hi> And that I might applie this to the time preſent,<note place="margin">And namely our deſire to haue the plague taken away.</note> and to the occaſion of our meeting: all men deſire, and haue done a long time, that God would ſtay his heauy hand, and that wee might not thus ſtill heare continually of the death of our brethren in ſo many places: But none of vs all can haue our deſires herein, but as God ſhall giue it. Therefore let vs pray vnto him, and aske it of him, (as the Apoſtle willeth vs) and the more earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we deſire it, the more feruently let vs pray vnto God for it: ſo will the Lord graunt it vnto vs in his good time; and ſo ſhall it appeare, that wee doe not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay in word; but beleeue in heart, that he onely can giue vs our deſire. And let vs remember for the further humbling of vs, how many deſires wee haue had in our mind in time paſt, and neuer thought vpon God, or ſought to him for the accompliſhment of them: and ſo no maruaile if we haue miſt of many of them; for God thereby hath puniſhed our vnbeleefe, that we did not by prayer (the fruit of faith) acknowledge that hee was the onely giuer of all our deſires: yea and that we haue deſired many great things, and ſuch as haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned vs verie much, and yet haue not asked them of God, and therefore worthily haue gone without them.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing God giueth all men their deſires, and we muſt pray to him for them; it behooueth vs to liue well, and to ſerue him, and to deſire nothing but good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually:
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7191:93"/> that ſo he may from time to time giue vs our hearts deſire, euen as <hi>Dauid</hi> did here And then God hath promiſed to giue vs our deſire,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prouer.</hi> 10.24.</note> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>That which the wicked feareth, ſhall come vpon him: but God will grant the deſire of the righteous.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What we muſt doe, that God might fulfill all our deſiers.</note> VVhere he ſaith, that the wicked ſhall be ſo farre from hauing their deſire, that euen that very thing which they feare moſt, and would moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly eſcape, God will bring vpon them: but hee will giue the righteous man his deſire. So that if we ſerue God, and doe liue well: then he will giue vs all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, that is, ſo farre as they be good, and agreeable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his will. And thus alſo is a righteous man deſcribed in the word of God, namely, That he is a righteous man, and ſhe a righteous woman, that hath good deſires: and ſo farre God will fulfill them. Therefore that we might pray in faith vnto God for all our deſires, we muſt liue righteouſly, and looke that all our deſires be only good. For though he doth ſometime giue the wicked their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly deſire, and that in many things, as we haue ſeene it in <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Ieſabell,</hi> and might haue ſeene it in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more; yea they haue more than their hearts deſire: yet it is no bleſsing at all, but a puniſhment of God vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, to be giuen vp to their owne luſts, to deſire euill things, and then to haue their deſires: though (I ſay) he dealeth thus often with the wicked, yet no man can pray for any ſuch thing in faith; neither can he looke for it at Gods hands: and if it ſhould come vnto him vnlooked for, he cannot take it as a bleſsing from God. VVe are rather to pray, that in all our wicked and vngodly deſires he would croſſe vs, and neuer ſuffer vs to thriue in any of our vnlawfull deſires: and that ſhall be a great bleſsing of his vpon vs, to haue our vngodly deſires denied vnto vs. But we ſhall find it to be true by all experience, that when we haue liued in the beſt courſe, and haue had moſt godly deſires, then the Lord hath moſt often and ſooneſt fulfilled them: ſo this muſt
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7191:93"/> teach vs to liue well, and to deſire good things of God, that he may ſtill fulfill them.</p>
               <p>And the rather that we might beleeue,<note place="margin">God can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der men of their greateſt deſires.</note> that God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can and doth fulfill the deſire of all men: we muſt conſider that he can alſo, and doth many time hinder them from their deſires: that though they haue had neuer ſo great a deſire to a thing, yet they could neuer obtaine it. And this is threatned to the vngodly, as a puniſhment from God, that they ſhall not haue their deſire: <hi>He ſhall gnaſh with his teeth, and conſume away,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7191:94"/> and their perſecutions extream and very long, enduring certaine hundred yeares; yet therein they ſo little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed, that the number of them ſtill encreaſed: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon aroſe that prouerbe, <hi>That the blood of the Martyrs is the ſeed of the Church,</hi> that is, the more that they did put to death, the more did riſe vp in their ſtead.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7191:95"/> vnto God for giuing him his deſire in the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of his enemies. VVe in our time haue deſired many things in our hearts, and we haue not been diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of our deſires: but haue we in all of them ſo conſidered God to be the author of them, that we haue giuen thankes vnto him for the ſame? If we doe rightly examine our ſelues,<note place="margin">But moſt men faile greatly in this praiſe.</note> and call to mind the time paſt, we ſhall find, that for many things for which we haue pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>O Lord giue me according to my heart,</hi> we haue not retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with this thankfull confeſsion, <hi>O Lord thou hast giuen me my hearts deſire, and haſt not denied me the request of my lips.</hi> And this is that that our Sauiour Chriſt complaineth of in the Goſpell,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 17.12.</note> That when ten lepers did meet him, they ſtood a farre off, and all of them lift vp their voices, and ſaid, <hi>Ieſus master haue mercie on vs:</hi> and all of them were healed. <hi>But one of them when he ſaw that he was healed, turned backe, and with a loud voice praiſed God, and fell downe at his feet, and gaue him thankes: And Ieſus ſaid, are there not ten clenſed? but where are the nine? There is none found that returned to giue God praiſe, ſaue this ſtranger.</hi> Thus though all of them had a great deſire to be cleanſed of that foule diſeaſe, and did crie out earneſtly vnto Chriſt for it, yet but one of them did teſtifie his faith, that he had receiued this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Chriſt. And this is a common fault in the world, that ſcarce one among ten, when they haue their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and that of God, and when they haue asked the ſame of him, that are mindfull to giue thanks vnto God that gaue them their deſire. Many in their wants come to Chriſt, and ſay <hi>Miſerere,</hi> to haue their deſires ſatisfied; but few afterwards returne with <hi>Alleluia,</hi> to giue praiſe vnto him for the ſame. This is that then, which the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt not without iuſt cauſe ſo often &amp; ſo earneſtly calleth vpon men for, and all ſorts of men: That when they haue bene in great affliction ſome one way &amp; ſome another, and ſo for their reliefe and comfort, they haue deſired this and that according to their ſeuerall eſtates; that
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7191:95"/> when God hath deliuered them, and giuen them their deſire, they would as well by giuing thankes vnto him declare, that they beleeue that he onely did ſatisfie their deſire, as they did before by praying vnto him.

                  <hi>and ſcattered into the enemies land, and there they haue wandered in the wilderneſſe and deſert out of the way, &amp; found no citie to dwell in; both hungrie and thirstie, and their ſoule hath fainted in them. Then they cryed vnto the Lord in their trouble, and he deliuered them from their diſtreſſe. Let them therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>confeſse before the Lord his louing kindneſſe, and his wonderfull workes before the ſonnes of men: for he ſatisfied the thirſtie ſoule, and filled the hungrie ſoule with good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> VVhere he prouoketh them to be thankefull, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of the goodneſſe of God with prayſe, when they haue found by experience how he hath ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their deſires; and would haue them ſhew that they beleeued, that God gaue them their deſires, by a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full acknowledging of the ſame. And ſo afterwards in the ſame Pſalme he ſpeaketh of others, whereof ſome are deliuered from ſickeneſſe and from death, and ſome from priſon and yrons, and ſome from extreme hunger; and all theſe according to their owne deſire: for he ſaith of all them, <hi>Then they cried vnto the Lord in their trouble,</hi>

                  <hi>and let them exalt him in the congregation of the people, and praiſe him in the aſsembly of the Elders.</hi> VVhere we ſee, that though he confeſſeth that all of them in their ſeuerall troubles doe cry vnto God for helpe, as belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that he onely can giue them their deſires: yet he doth not ſay, that all after their deliuerances doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their faith in Gods prouidence, by giuing him
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7191:96"/> thankes: but this he exhorteth them vnto, and wiſheth that it might be ſo, ſaying, Let them therefore confeſſe before the Lord his louing kindneſſe: or, oh that they would thus doe.<note place="margin">So muſt we do when he ſhall giue vs our deſires, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the plague.</note> Shewing that though it be mens duty, yet many of them are ſo farre from it, that it is rather to be wiſhed and deſired, than to be looked for at their hands. Therefore if it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto vs, and this way to giue vs our deſire, by taking away this grieuous rod from our backes, and cauſing this peſtilence to ceaſe, which hath a long time walked in the darkeneſſe,<note place="margin">

And let vs be heartily ſory that for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deſires of ours, both for ſoule and body, for our ſelues and ours, we haue bene ſo vnthankefull; which might iuſtly moue him to abridge vs now, and to cut vs ſhort of our deſire in this thing, which doth ſo greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the good of vs all, and of many thouſands of our brethren.

                  <note place="margin">Fulfill all thy purpoſe or counſell.</note>The ſecond followeth after this manner: <hi>And fulfill all thy purpoſe.</hi> This latter part of the verſe conteineth almoſt the very ſame petition that the former did, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that here is ſomewhat more, namely, that whereas men, when they haue a deſire vnto a thing, and would faine haue it, they begin to bethinke themſelues how
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:7191:96"/> and which way to accompliſh it: and then taking coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell with themſelues or others, they deuiſe and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to doe ſo and ſo: as <hi>Dauid</hi> might doe in this caſe. This counſell of his and purpoſe, whatſoeuer it was, he willeth them to pray to God for him, that he would ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill, that ſo he might haue his deſire, and Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence might be ſerued thereby. This word, Purpoſe, the moſt and the beſt doe tranſlate, Counſell. And ſo the meaning of it is, that whatſoeuer he ſhould aduiſe himſelfe to doe by good counſell, for the effecting of his deſire, and whatſoeuer things he ſhould put in practiſe vpon mature deliberation to that end: that that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and thoſe meanes God would bleſſe, and giue a good ſucceſſe vnto, and ſo bring the thing to paſſe. So that we ſee with what humilitie and diſtruſtfulneſſe of himſelfe he ſpeaketh, acknowledging his owne inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie to be ſo great, that hee was ſo vnable of himſelfe to bring to paſſe his owne deſires, though they were good, and in a lawfull cauſe; that when he had taken the beſt counſell for it, yet that ſhould be in vaine and altogether fruſtrate, and doe him no good at all, vnleſſe God bleſſe it. Therefore here he prayeth vnto God for his bleſsing vpon his conſultations, and good purpoſes, and deſireth them to help him with their prayers therin: both that God would direct him to thoſe meanes that might beſt ſerue his prouidence, and that he would giue good ſucceſſe vnto the ſame; and that he might not fall into any vaine courſes, or as it were crooked wayes,<note place="margin">They aske of God good counſell, and the ſucceſſe of the ſame.</note> which the Lord did not purpoſe to worke by. This then muſt pull down the high minds of thoſe proud conceited men, who thinke ſo highly of themſelues and of their owne wit, that they preſume that for euery thing they are all ſufficient of themſelues: for in all matters that ſhall befall them, they can tell preſently what to doe, they can tell how to aduiſe themſelues ſufficiently, they haue counſell ynough at home, and ſo can bring all their
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7191:97"/> matters to paſſe. For though I graunt it to be true, that it is a great bleſsing of God vpon any, that in time of need they know what is to be done (for many times for want of good counſell men are in doubfull matters greatly perplexed, and almoſt at their wits end:) yet they muſt thus thinke, that when they haue the beſt aduiſe that can be from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues or others, yet the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of it depends only vpon the bleſsing of God: and ſo they muſt ſeeke vnto God for it, as <hi>Dauid</hi> doth here, though he was very wiſe of himſelfe: For it is ſayd of him when he was but young,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.30.</note> 
                  <hi>That when the princes of the Philistims went foorth, at their going forth to warre, he behaued himſelfe more wiſely than all the ſeruants of Saul; ſo that his name was much ſet by.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for the repreſsing of this fooliſh preſumption of our owne wiſedome, to be able to bring all matters to paſſe, the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> giueth a good leſſon, ſaying, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jere.</hi> 9.23.</note> 
                  <hi>let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſedome, nor the ſtrong man glory in his ſtrength, neither the rich man glory in his riches: but let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and knoweth me.</hi> For though a man haue wiſedome to deuiſe,<note place="margin">God onely eſtabliſheth and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth mens counſels.</note> ſtrength, and riches to bring to paſſe, (and where theſe three concurre there is likelihood of great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) yet euen then God onely bringeth the purpoſe to paſſe. For either we ſhall not reſolue vpon the beſt, or take good counſell when it is giuen vs, or if we doe, God can deſtroy it. This we ſee to be true in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of <hi>Achitophell,</hi> who was one of the wiſeſt men of his time, in ſo much, that that which he counſelled, was like as one had asked counſell at the oracle of God:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.23.</note> when in the conſpiracie of <hi>Abſalom</hi> he gaue counſell one way, and <hi>Huſhay</hi> the Archite gaue counſell another way; though the firſt counſell was beſt at that time, yet it was not followed:<note place="margin">Chap. 17.14.</note> but all of them ſayd, <hi>The counſell of Huſhai is better than the counſell of Achitophell:</hi> For the Lord had determined to deſtroy the good counſell of <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phell,</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:7191:97"/> that he might bring euill vpon <hi>Abſalom.</hi> Thus we may here learne that it is in God onely to ouerthrow or to eſtabliſh the counſels of men, euen of the wiſeſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he is purpoſed to doe good vnto, or bring euill vpon them. So was it alſo in the dayes of King <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam</hi> the ſonne and heire of <hi>Solomon,</hi> when in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his raigne the people came vnto him with this petition,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 10.4.</note> 
                  <hi>That he would make the grieuous yoake which his father had put vpon them, lighter, and they would ſerue him:</hi> and he bad them depart for three dayes, and then come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for an anſwere: and in the meane time he asked counſell of the wiſe, auncient, experienced men, which had ſerued his father; and they gaue him good counſell, that he ſhould yeeld to them in this requeſt: and he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conferred with the young men, who had bene his pages and brought vp with him, and they gaue him ill counſell, (as appeared by the ſequell) That he ſhould take it vpon him like a king, and ſpeake roughly vnto them: and ſo he did, refuſing the good counſell of the auncient men. And thus though their counſel was good, God did not fulfill it; and though it was offered vnto him, he did not take it; becauſe the Lord would bring that vpon <hi>Solomon,</hi> which he had threatned by <hi>Ahiiah</hi> the Prophet, <hi>That for their idolatrie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 11.31.</note> 
                  <hi>ten tribes ſhould be rent away from his kingdome, in the dayes of his ſonne:</hi> as alſo came to paſſe: for when they heard the anſwere of the king, ten tribes fell away to <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> and could neuer be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered. So that whenſoeuer we determine to doe any thing, as we ought to take counſell, and doe nothing raſhly and vnaduiſedly, as many doe (for then we ſhall thriue thereafter:) ſo we muſt alſo beleeue that God muſt bring all things to paſſe, and ſo pray to him for it continually. So that all men when they haue the beſt counſell in the world, if it were as good as <hi>Achitophels,</hi> they muſt ſeeke to God by prayer for his bleſsing vpon it, if they will haue things to thriue &amp; proſper with them.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">When we haue taken the beſt counſell, we pray to God for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of it.</note>And this is true in all things: as if we haue to deale with men that ſeeke to oppreſſe vs any wayes, we muſt take the beſt counſell that we can to defend our ſelues, and then pray to God, that hee would bring things to paſſe: otherwiſe our owne counſell and purpoſe ſhall doe vs no good againſt their oppreſsions. So was it in the time of the Iewes captiuitie, when <hi>Haman</hi> for malice that he bore vnto <hi>Mordecay,</hi> ſought his deſtruction; and becauſe his malice was vnſatiable, he thought it too litle to lay hands vpon him onely,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heſt.</hi> 3.6.</note> but becauſe they had ſhewed him the people of <hi>Mordicay,</hi> he ſought to deſtroy all the Iewes at once that were throughout the whole kingdome of <hi>Ahaſhueroſh:</hi> &amp; to that end vnder the colour of the kings profit, he gat a decree to be ſealed with his ſignet, That vpon ſuch a day all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be rooted out &amp; deſtroied, both young &amp; old, women &amp; children. This ſeemed vnto him very good pollicie to bring his purpoſe to paſſe; and when the poſts with the kings let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were ſent out into all places, he might haue thought himſelfe ſure of it: but God did not proſper it, and ſo it came to naught, and his purpoſe was diſappointed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God did not fulfill it.<note place="margin">Chap. 5.14.</note> And afterwards when <hi>Zereſh</hi> his wife &amp; all his friends gaue him this counſel, That ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was in ſo great fauor with the king &amp; the queen, as to be inuited with the king vnto a banquet which the queene had prepared, and none but he was inuited; that he would make a gibbet of fiftie cubites hie, and in the morning when hee went vnto the king, that he would ſpeake vnto him, that <hi>Mordecay</hi> might be hanged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and then he ſhould goe ioyfully with the king vnto the banquet.

But on the other ſide,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7191:98"/> when <hi>Hester</hi> and <hi>Mordecay</hi> did heare of this wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and did aduiſe with themſelues what was beſt to be done for the ſafegard of the life of the Iewes; and at the laſt did reſolue vpon this,<note place="margin">Chap. 4.8.</note> That the queene ſhould goe into the king, and make ſupplication for her people: and ſhe did ſo. This good counſell, and the ſucceſſe thereof, they commended vnto God in prayer, yea in faſting and prayer, three daies and three nights together; and this God bleſſed, and brought it to paſſe: ſo that they had libertie from the king,<note place="margin">Chap. 8.11.</note> both to ſtand for their owne liues, and to deſtroy all the power of the people that vexed them, both children and women, and to ſpoyle their goods: and they did ſo. And truly, if all men in all controuerſies which they haue with their aduerſaries, would firſt take good counſell, according to Gods word; and then acknowledge, that the ſucceſſe of it is in Gods hand, and pray earneſtly vnto him for it: they might proſper more in their ſuites at the law, than they doe. But becauſe they neglect this, and for the moſt part ſeeke for craftie counſell, ſuch as hath no promiſe of Gods bleſsing, becauſe it is contrarie to the law of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; and then in ſuch caſes they neither doe nor can pray to God for his bleſsing vpon it, that he would ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill all their counſell: therefore it is not ſo. And thus we ſee, why ſome are ouerthrowne in their good cauſes: namely, they ſeeke not to God, that he would fulfill all their counſels, but thinke themſelues ſufficient without his bleſsing, and ſo God leaueth them to themſelues, that by experience they might ſee it to bee otherwiſe. Therefore let vs profit vnto our dutie by other mens harmes.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, whereas <hi>Dauid</hi> was a king, and now gone out to warre, and willeth the people at home to pray to God for him, <hi>That hee would fulfill all his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and counſell;</hi> wee muſt vnderſtand thus much, that as he was wiſe himſelfe, ſo he had his counſell both for
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7191:99"/> warre and for peace, as all kings haue; and they were to aduiſe him in euery action what was beſt to be done: yet he reſted not in that,<note place="margin">We ought to pray that God would bleſſe the conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the king and his counſellors.</note> but deſireth the people, that they would pray, That God would fulfill all, which by his grace they ſhould determine: and they did ſo. So muſt we doe for the kings highneſſe. And though he be god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wiſe himſelfe, and hath many worthie noblemen of his moſt Honourable priuie Counſell, who are of great wiſedome and long experience: as they muſt not reſt in their owne deuices, but commend them vnto God in prayer, and deſire others alſo that are about them, that they would doe ſo; and by this meanes might they greatly proſper: ſo is it our bound dutie to pray vnto God for them, that he would bleſſe their conſultations, and bring them to paſſe, for the good of his Church, and profit of this realme. And as they doe weekely meet at the Counſell table, and ſometime oftner, for matters of State; ſo we ſhould continually commend them to God in all our prayers: ſo ſhall we haue the benefit of our owne prayers, when God ſhall fulfill the good things that they purpoſe. And as we ought to doe thus alwais, ſo eſpecially againſt the Parliament, we ſhould pray that God would fulfill all the good purpoſes of that great aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, for the rooting out of Poperie, and all remnants of ſuperſtition,<note place="margin">Eſpecially all conſultations in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment houſe.</note> and all other abuſes, and for the eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing and enlarging of the preaching of the Goſpel, and all other good orders in all places. Otherwiſe we ſee, that good counſell may be giuen, but not followed; and if it be, yet not brought to paſſe: and ſo there ſhall not that good be done that might, and which many good men in the Parliament houſe intend. Therefore as we deſire to enioy the common benefit of our time, ſo let vs pray, not onely for the King, but for all our gouernors in the Church and Commonwealth, That God would fulfill all their purpoſes.</p>
               <p>Then ought we much more thus to pray for our
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7191:99"/> ſelues, if we were a great deale wiſer than we are; for when we haue taken the beſt aduice, and thereupon do things to one end, they may fall out to another,<note place="margin">And all our own counſels and purpoſes.</note> yea cleane contrarie to that which we purpoſed, and ſo we ſhall be diſappointed. As for example, in matters of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage (which is an ordinarie thing) ſome think to ioyne themſelues or their children in alliance with ſuch and ſuch, hoping thereby to aduance their houſes:<note place="margin">As in matter of mariage.</note> but it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out otherwiſe, and by that meanes they come to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, and ſo God doth not fulfill their purpoſe. And this was the very caſe of king <hi>Iehoſhaphat,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.1.

For, to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this, how <hi>Edom</hi> preſently rebelled, and fell away from him, and made a king ouer them;<note place="margin">Verſ. 8.</note> nor how <hi>Iehoram</hi> fell into idolatrie after the manner of the kings of Iſrael, and compelled the people thereunto;<note place="margin">Otherwiſe they may fall out to a clean contrary end.</note> for which he came to a miſerable end, being ſicke of ſore diſeaſes, ſo that his guts fell out at the end of two yeares: all his children afterwards were ſlaine by the Aramites, ſauing the youngeſt, whom they made king in his fathers roome: and this man <hi>Ahaziah</hi> was ſlaine by <hi>Iehu:</hi>

Therefore whatſoeuer good we purpoſe either for our ſelues, or for our children, or for our friends, let vs pray heartely vnto God to fulfill them; els we may purpoſe one thing, and God by the ſame meanes that we vſe, ſhall bring to paſſe another. And how God can alter mens purpoſes, we ſee it in the example of <hi>Iacob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">God can alter all mens pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.14.</note> and of his children.

But when he came among them, they ſold
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7191:100"/> him into another countrey, and ſent his coat home to his father dipped in blood, as though he had been ſlaine with ſome wild beaſt: ſo <hi>Iacob</hi> was diſappointed of his purpoſe. And ſo were the brethren of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> alſo: for firſt of all, they ſought to kill him, and after they ſold him for a ſeruant, that he might neuer be aboue them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which God had ſhewed him in dreames: but by this meanes he came into Aegypt, and there in proceſſe of time he was made ruler of the whole land: and in the time of famine his brethren came thither to buy corne, &amp; bowed before him, &amp; did him great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, when they knew it not: and ſo Gods purpoſe was eſtabliſhed, and not theirs, who had ſent him thither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand for their preſeruation,<note place="margin">Chap. 48.5.</note> as himſelfe afterwards doth confeſſe vnto them.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of our owne iournies:<note place="margin">As when they purpoſe any iournie.</note> A man ſhall purpoſe ſuch a thing, to goe to ſuch a place at ſuch a time, and either things ſhall ſo fall out from day to day, that he ſhall not compaſſe it, and ſo it ſhall ſtill be deferred againſt his will; or els when he doth go, things ſhall fall out otherwiſe with him, than he thought, and ſo he ſhall goe to another end than he purpoſed at the firſt.

                     <hi>Act.</hi> 23.12.</note> and fortie men had bound themſelues with an oath to doe it) to appeale vnto <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Emperour of Rome.<note place="margin">Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſubmit all our purpoſes to the will of God.</note> Thus he had not his purpoſe in his iourney, when and as he would. Therefore let vs ſubmit all our purpoſes vnto the will of God, and deſire him to haue them fulfilled,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7191:101"/> ſo farre forth as it pleaſeth him, as <hi>Paule</hi> did, praying, that at one time or other he might haue a proſperous iourny by the will of God to come vnto them: and when we ſee that it is not his will (as <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.13.</note> he was hetherto letted) let vs be contented to ſtay at home, and to be croſſed in our purpoſes. And yet if our deſires be good, let vs continue in them, and pray as he did, that at one time or other we might haue a proſperous iourney by the will of God. And let vs not be ſo obſtinatly ſet vpon any thing (as the manner of ſome is) that we ſhould be reſtleſſe, when we haue not our mind and purpoſe in euery thing: for then if we be headſtrong, as the Lord can hinder vs whether we will or no; ſo if we will needs doe according to our owne purpoſe, we ſhall find, that all things ſhall not fall out as we looked for. And this we ſee plainely in the example of <hi>Balaam</hi> the ſorcerer, who would needs goe at the requeſt of <hi>Baalack</hi> king of Moab,<note place="margin">Elſe he can croſſe and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh vs in them.</note> in hope of great gaine and preferment that was promiſed vnto him, to curſe the Iſraelits, and ſo to root them out by his inchantments. The Lord did ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew him (by the courſe of his prouidence, and ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe that he had in the way) that it was not his will that he ſhould goe;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Num.</hi> 23.7, 8.</note> yet he would needs goe on. But when he came there, he was driuen to doe cleane contrarie to his purpoſe, euen to bleſſe them, though he ſought di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers times, and ſet his diuinations to curſe them: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the king of Moab was greatly angry with him, and it is moſt like that he loſt his reward, and ſo he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of his purpoſe in this iourney, where he was not contented to be ordered by the Lord, but would go (as it were) againſt his will. And in his returne home he was ſlaine in battell by the Iſraelites.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Num.</hi> 31.8.</note> Thus when he thought that he had had his purpoſe, then did he moſt of all miſſe of it, becauſe God did not fulfill it.</p>
               <p>Therefore when we purpoſe any thing, and haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken counſell for it, and haue alſo very good meanes to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7191:101"/> bring it to paſſe, let vs pray vnto God, that if it be his holy will, he would fulfill it. And in matters of great moment, let vs not content our ſelues with our owne prayers, but deſire others to pray to God for vs, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did here deſire the people thus to pray to God for him, <hi>The Lord graunt thee according to thine heart, and fulfill all thy purpoſe:</hi> ſo may we ſpeed well of our purpoſes, as he did. And when we haue purpoſed ſo and ſo; and it hath fallen out otherwiſe, not according to our purpoſe, (as in many things often it doth, and they that are wiſe to obſerue things, ſhall ſoone perceiue it) it is to teach vs to depend vpon Gods prouidence, who onely bringeth all things to paſſe, according to his owne decree; and let vs make that good vſe of it. That when we ſee, how in diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing vs of our purpoſes, the Lord hath ſometimes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> prouided better for vs than we had purpoſed our ſelues;<note place="margin">How we ſhold profit, when we are diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of our purpoſes.</note> we might be thankefull vnto him, and learne thereby in all things to depend vpon him, who hath ſo greatly ſhewed his care ouer vs, and not to truſt too much to our ſelues. As we muſt needs confeſſe, that in many things the Lord hath thus dealt with vs. But if things fall out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> worſe with vs, than we had purpoſed, (as ſometimes alſo it doth) we ſee how God can hinder vs of our beſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that ſo we may alwaies in them pray vnto him, that he would bleſſe them. And let vs for all our life paſt and for all things that haue befallen vs in the ſame, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and confeſſe, as the truth is, to the glorie of God, &amp; our own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, That whatſoeuer good we haue purpoſed for our owne benefit, or the welfare of others, and it hath ſo come to paſſe; that it was God only, that did fulfill them,<note place="margin">And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be fulfilled.</note> whatſoeuer the meanes were: for both they and the ſucceſſe of them were of him, and ſo let vs be thankefull vnto him for the ſame. And let vs not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> aſcribe them either to our good fortune and chance, as though things fell out vncertainely, we know not how: neither to our owne wit and policie, to our own ſtrength
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7191:102"/> and power, as though we were ſufficient in our ſelues: as many are too ready to ſay, I may thanke my good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune for ſuch a thing, or I may thanke my ſelfe for it, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> my wit, or my hands for this that I haue: but let vs thanke God, who onely bringeth to paſſe the purpoſes of all men. So ſhall we for the time to come learne to depend vpon him for our ſelues and for all ours, beyond that that we can ſee; when as we remember how for the time paſt he hath prouided better for vs, than we had purpoſed, or could haue done for our ſelues. VVhereas when it is otherwiſe, God looſeth his praiſe, and we the fruit of his fatherly dealing and mercifull prouidence towards vs. And this is that that we haue to obſerue out of the fourth verſe.</p>

And this they expreſſe more fully in the next words, when as they ſay, <hi>And ſet vp our banners in the name of our God, &amp;c.</hi> that is, That we thus hauing the victory, and triumphing ouer our enemies, might as conquerors, not onely inwardly reioyce, but outwardly declare it; not to our owne prayſe, or the prayſe of our king ſo much, but to the glory of the name of our God.

Thus haue the ſeruants of God prayed, and haue obtained great things, when they haue deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them for the glory of God.

And as ſhe did this way ſufficiently ſhew, that ſhe ſought not her ſelfe in it, but God: ſo afterwards ſhe did it much more in prayſing God for it, and in performing her vow; when ſhee brought him to the houſe of the Lord in Shyloh,<note place="margin">Chap. 2.18.</note> ſo ſoone as ſhee had weaned him, and there left
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7191:103"/> him with <hi>Hely</hi> the prieſt: whereby it came to paſſe, that he miniſtred before the Lord being a young child, gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a linnen Ephod. Thus ſhe was contented to depart from him ſo ſoone as ſhe had him, whereby ſhee declared, that in her petition ſhe reſpected Gods glory more than her ſelfe.

               <p>King <hi>Solomon</hi> when he prayed for wiſedome,<note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 3.6.</note> vſeth the ſame reaſons to perſuade the Lord, and to confirme his owne faith, namely, That whereas God had made him king in his father <hi>Dauids</hi> roume, and that ouer a great people, therefore it would pleaſe God to giue him wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<note place="margin">And King <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> that he might be fit to ſerue him in that place whereunto he had called him, by being able to iudge both good and euill. Thus he propoundeth the glory of God in his calling before his eyes, when he asked this; and it ſo pleaſed God, that he gaue him that, and a great deale more. So no doubt if men were deſirous to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God in their callings, and did aske of him gifts meet for them to that end, and in ſeeking for gifts of the mind did make the glory of God the principall end, they might obtaine great things of God. But for the moſt part men ſeeke wiſedome and learning, to ſet forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and therein ſeeke their owne wealth and credit, either wholly, or more than the other; and not the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of a good conſcience in the right vſe of them, to the glory of God: and ſo either miſſe of them, or haue them not in that meaſure that others haue, and as they might attaine vnto themſelues. The Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:7191:104"/> was wholly taken vp with the glorie of God, when he contended with the prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> and ſo by prayer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained fire from heauen to conſume his ſacrifice:<note place="margin">And <hi>Elias</hi> both for fire from heauen.</note> for the contention was, VVhether God or <hi>Baal</hi> were the true God.<note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 18.37.</note> Therefore hee prayed thus, <hi>Heare me, O Lord, and let the people know, that thou art the Lord God.</hi> And then his zeale appeared afterwards in killing all thoſe falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> that had a long time ſeduced the people: and after in the ſame zeale he prayed for raine,<note place="margin">Verſ. 42. And for raine.</note> and did obtaine it after a great drought of three yeares and an halfe. Thus we ſee what great things may be obtained of God by prayer, when therein wee ſeeke his glory. This example the Apoſtle ſetteth before our eyes, when he willeth vs to pray for them that be ſicke, with hope of obtaining health, and forgiueneſſe of ſinnes for them:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.17.</note> For ſaith he, <hi>The prayer of one righteous man auaileth much, when it is feruent.</hi> As <hi>Elias,</hi> being a man like vs, yet inflamed with Gods glorie, did pray that there might be no raine, that the people by that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be brought to know God; and after pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there might be raine, that by his mercie they might know it much more: and he obtained both. And ſo if in our prayers we were thus touched with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God, we might obtaine great things: but for the moſt part, men reſpect themſelues in their prayers, and not God, and ſo obtaine little or nothing. And the ſame <hi>Elijah</hi> when he prayed for fire to conſume the captaines and their fiftie men, when they came to fetch him to the king of Iſrael by force, ſaying, <hi>Thou man of God, the king commaundeth thee to come to him,</hi> as if they had ſaid, Thou ſaiſt, that thou art a man of God, well let vs ſee whether he can keepe thee from the king. He anſwered them: <hi>If I be a man of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 1.10.</note> 
                  <hi>let fire come downe from heauen, and conſume thee, and thy fiftie:</hi> and ſo it did. He did not thus pray in any priuat reuenge, but that it might be known, that he was a true Prophet, and that that meſſage was true that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:7191:104"/> he ſent vnto the king before, namely, that when he was ſicke, and ſent to <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the god of Eſron, to know whether he ſhould recouer or no:<note place="margin">Verſ. 2.</note> he ſent him this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, <hi>That becauſe he had forſaken the true God, and ſent to them that were no gods, he ſhould not come from the bed on which he was, but he ſhould die there,</hi> as alſo he did. Now when the diſciples of Chriſt deſired that fire might come downe from heauen to conſume the Samaritanes, and their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, becauſe they would not receiue him, when he was going towards Ieruſalem; they obtained it not, though they pretended the example of <hi>Elias,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Master,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 9.54.</note> 
                  <hi>wilt thou that we commaund fire from heauen, and deſtroy them, as Elias did? He ſaid, they had not that ſpirit, &amp; did it not to that end that he did:</hi> namely, the glorie of God, but in reſpect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. So then, if we will obtaine any thing at the hand of God, we muſt therein ſeeke his glorie, and deſire it to that end, that thereby God may be glorified and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; as the people doe here, when they ſay, <hi>That we may reioyce, and ſet vp our banners in the name of our God, when hee ſhall fulfill all thy petitions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the ground of the prayer of <hi>Moſes</hi> for the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelits in the wilderneſſe, whereby he often obtained great things for them. As when the Lord would haue deſtroyed them for their idolatrie with the golden calfe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.12.</note> and haue made of <hi>Moſes</hi> a mightie people, he prayeth vnto God, that he would not do ſo: for then the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians would ſpeake ill of God, and ſay, that he maliciou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly brought them out from thence, to deſtroy them in the wilderneſſe: and ſo he not ſeeking his owne glory, but the glorie of God herein, obtained, that they were ſpared contrarie to their deſerts.<note place="margin">And <hi>Moſes,</hi> that God would ſpare the Iſraelits for the glorie of his name.</note> And ſo afterwards, when the ſpies, that were ſent to ſpie out the land of Canaan, brought vp an ill report of that pleaſant land of promiſe, contrarie to all truth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Num.</hi> 14.13.</note> and by that means diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the people, ſo that they all murmured againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> that they had brought them thether, to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7191:105"/> fall by the ſword of their enemies, God ſaid, That he would deſtroy them with the peſtilence, but make of him a mightier nation than they: <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed for them and ſaid, That the Aegyptians would ſay, that God was not able to bring them in: and ſo to ſtop the mouths of the enemies, and for the glorie of God, he deſireth that he would ſpare them; and ſo he did. Thus ought we to pray for our ſelues, and for the Church of God, that he would turne from vs all thoſe euils that we haue moſt righteouſly deſired, euen for the glorie of his name; and therein not reſpect our ſelues ſo much, as Gods glorie, that we profeſsing his name, it might not be ill ſpoken of for our puniſhments. And truly this ſhould be one principall reaſon to mooue vs to pray for the remoouing of this plague,<note place="margin">So ought we to pray for the remoouing of this plague.</note> that the Atheiſts, and Papiſts, and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings doe not ſpeake ill of Gods name, and of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and his Goſpell, when he ſo greatly puniſheth them that profeſſe it. And alſo, that we our ſelues and others might (by remoouing of it) haue cauſe to praiſe his holy name. And indeed, if we did leſſe reſpect our ſelues herein, as for the moſt part men do wholly, and be more carefull of Gods glorie; as that by the ſtaying of it, he might be praiſed: yea, and iuſtice might be executed to the glorie of God, the courſe of which now for a while hath beene ſtayed in many places, becauſe they could not ſo ſafely meet for feare of the infection: and that good things might be eſtabliſhed, and ill remooued by a Parliament (which it is like ſhould haue beene long before, if this peſtilence had not beene ſo vniuerſall, and ſo mortall;) we might obtaine by our prayers a great deale more than we doe.</p>

Therefore let vs be ſo inflamed with the zeale of Gods glorie, that we may pray, as the people doe here, Giue me this, and giue me that, that we may ſing of thy ſaluation, and ſet vp our banners in the name of the Lord our God, when he ſhall fulfill all our petitions.

So then, whether we aske
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7191:106"/> the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, or the increaſe of faith, or any other of the graces of God, to lead an holy life, we muſt reſpect the glorie of God in them, and that we and others may praiſe him for them.

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 31.16. <hi>Act.</hi> 9.36.</note> and <hi>Dorcas</hi> did: and to be ſhort, all other gifts of bodie to this end eſpecially, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did aske wiſedome for that cauſe: and Queene <hi>Heſter</hi> did put on her royall apparrell,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hest.</hi> 5.1.</note> and dreſt vp her ſelfe well, that ſo in the preſence of the king ſhe might find fauour in dealing for the Church of God: then may we be bould with great comfort to commend them to God, for in them wee ſeeke not our ſelues, but his glory, which is moſt deare to himſelf alſo. But for the moſt part, men in all things ſeeke themſelues onely, or principally, and ſo haue them not as they deſire. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we lacke any thing that we haue deſired, and prayed for, conſider whether we did ſeeke Gods glory in it, or our owne benefit; if we had reſpect to our ſelues, then no maruaile if we did want it, that we might learne to reforme our deſires. For though God giueth vnto men, that ſeeke only themſelues, as he doth to the wicked, yea vnto the bruit beaſts, becauſe he is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it ſelfe, and would hereby draw all men vnto him; yet how much more would he doe it, if men did ſeeke his glory therein? For though a maſter will giue his ſeruant that, which is for his owne profit onely; yet he will graunt him that ſuit eſpecially, which ſhall make for the credit of his maſter, and whereby he may doe him the better ſeruice: moſt of all, when he ſeeth that he ſeeketh for it in that reſpect principally: ſo will the Lord deale with all his faithful ſeruants much more, giue
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7191:107"/> them (I ſay) that ſometimes wherein they reſpect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues onely, but moſt of all that whereby they deſire to be furthered in his ſeruice, and to glorifie his name, a great deale more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That we may reioyce in thy ſaluation, &amp;c.</hi> As he hath in theſe words noted what was the end of their deſires, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand; ſo alſo what ſhould be the fruit of them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and what they would doe for them; namely, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in this great benefit beſtowed vpon them, and prayſe his name for it. And this ſhould be the fruit of all Gods benefits vpon vs,<note place="margin">The fruit of all Gods benefits in vs, ſhould be the prayſe of his name.</note> both publike and priuat: that as he by them offereth vs occaſion of praiſing him, ſo wee ſhould doe it for them; as wee ſee in the next Pſalme this people do, according to that that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe here. And truely then doe we rightly profit by all Gods benefits, when we giue him that prayſe for them, that is due vnto him: and when we ſo vſe them, and ſpeake of them, as God the authour of them, may be honoured. For to this end God giueth all, and this is all that we can doe for all, To prayſe him in heart, word and life: therefore if we doe not this, all is loſt vpon vs. And euery one as he receiueth more from God, ſo is he bound to this the more, to ſing of them to God, that is, to praiſe his name for them; <hi>And to ſet vp their banners in his name,</hi> that is, to ſet forth his glory. So that the pooreſt that is, is bound vnto it, for their life, health, food, and rayment, &amp;c. &amp; other common benefits that they inioy: for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue leaſt, they haue more than they haue deſerued. But the rich are bound vnto it a great deale more, by how much they goe beyond others in Gods benefits; for he did owe them nothing, and he might haue made them like others: yea and he can ſo do when he will;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Daniel</hi> 4.30.</note> as he dealt with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> whom of a proud king he made a vile beaſt. And this is ſo proper vnto all the benefits of God, that where he ſpeaketh of many of them, he beginneth and endeth the Pſalme thus, <hi>My
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7191:107"/> ſoule prayſe thou the Lord.</hi> And in another,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40 3.</note> ſpeaking of a new benefit that God had beſtowed on him, he ſaith, <hi>Thou hast put a new ſong of prayſe into my mouth:</hi> ſhewing what we ſhould doe when God bleſſeth vs, for euery benefit giue him new praiſes. And in another Pſalme praying for the forgiueneſſe of his ſinne, he ſaith, <hi>Open thou my lips O Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.15.</note> 
                  <hi>and my mouth ſhall ſhew foorth thy prayſe:</hi> as if he had ſayd, If God ſhall beſtow this benefit vpon me, then I will praiſe him for it.</p>
               <p>As we ſhould doe thus for all Gods benefits,<note place="margin">We ſhould more ſpecially praiſe God for thoſe benefits, which we haue asked of him.</note> ſo moſt of all for thoſe, which we haue asked of him: as they ſay here; <hi>When he ſhall fulfill all thy petitions:</hi> they had prayed before, that God would heare them, and now they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe this, <hi>That they will ſet vp their banners in his name.</hi> And there is great reaſon of this, for beſides the benefits that we receiue, which deſerue prayſe, we haue thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the goodneſſe of God in hearing our praiers. Thus we read in the Goſpell, that when ten leapers were cleanſed, all of them hauing begged it of Chriſt before, ſaying, <hi>Ieſus maſter haue mercie vpon vs;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 17.17.</note> but one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to giue thankes: and Chriſt asketh for the other nine, and ſo ſheweth what was their dutie alſo, namely, that as they had asked this benefit with him, ſo they ſhould haue returned with him to giue thankes. And to this end is it ſayd ſo often in the Pſalme, where he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how in ſundry afflictions men crie vnto God, and he heareth them, and deliuereth them:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.8.15.21.31.</note> 
                  <hi>Let them therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſse before the Lord, his louing kindneſse, and his wonderfull works before the ſonnes of men:</hi> where he exhorteth all to praiſe God for thoſe benefits which hee hath beſtowed vpon them at their prayers. But indeed this doctrine is ſo well knowne, that it needeth no great proofe, there is none ſo ignorant or ſo vnthankefull, that will denie it: onely we had need to examine our ſelues, how we doe practiſe it: whether we haue endeuoured to praiſe God for all his benefits, and eſpecially for thoſe that we haue
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7191:108"/> moſt deſired: &amp; when we haue had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether we haue ben any whit the more carefull to ſet forth the prayſe of God for them, than before. Now if we find by this triall, that the more that God hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, the more we haue glorified him; then may we haue comfort and hope of the continuance of them: but if in the abundance of all Gods benefits,<note place="margin">Let vs examin whether as Gods benefits encreaſe, ſo we ſet foorth his glory the more</note> we take our eaſe, and ſet out our ſelues to the world, and grow more proud, and be leſſe carefull to glorifie God (as moſt commonly it falleth out;) then we prouoke God to take them away, or to puniſh vs in them. Therefore let euery one conſider, what good he doth with all that he hath, and how by Gods bleſsings (as wealth and ſuch like) not his owne name is aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, but what good he hath done ſince for the ſeruice and glory of God. If he ſee they goe together, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Gods benefits vpon him, and the increaſe of Gods glory in him, it is well, and he hath cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce: but if the one increaſe greatly, and the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, or ſtand at a ſtay, then it is the next way to looſe all. As we are taught in the parable of the Talents,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.24.</note> he that hid that one that he had, in a napkin, and did no good with it, nor vſe it to his maſters aduantage, it was taken from him, and he is called an euill and vnprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant: So all are vnprofitable, that in their ſeuerall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings vſe not that which God giueth them, to his glory: and this ſhalbe the end of them, That all that they haue ſhall be taken from them, and they ſhall haue their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the wicked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That we may reioyce, &amp;c.</hi> As they haue deſired helpe of God for the glory of his name, and promiſed to prayſe him for it; ſo more particularly they ſay, that they ſhall reioyce in the ſaluation of the king:<note place="margin">They pray for this benefit, that they might reioice</note> namely, if God would helpe him out of the hands of his enemies, and giue him victorie ouer them. For in the preſeruation of the king, was the good of the whole Church, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth; therefore if he did well they ſhould reioice,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7191:108"/> and in his hurt and loſſe was the loſſe of them all, and ſo they ſhould haue cauſe to ſorrow. Therfore they vſe this alſo as a reaſon to perſuade the Lord to hear them, That wheras now they were doubtfull or rather in great feare, he by the victorie would giue them cauſe to reioice. And though they ſhew whereunto their ioy ſhould tend, namely to the prayſe of God, <hi>ſinging vnto him of his ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſetting vp their banners in his name;</hi> yet they exclude not this, but rather include it, namely, the common ioy of all the people, and of the whole Church of God. So that we may lawfully deſire of God ſuch things as we want, to this end, euen that we might reioyce: and this one thing is ſufficient to moue the Lord to giue them; euen that thereby we might haue cauſe to reioyce: as we muſt confeſſe, that then we ſhal haue cauſe ſo to doe. For beſides the comfort of the thing that he giueth, which may cleere vp the outward and inward man: the inuiſible things alſo of God are to be ſeene in his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and benefites, as his wiſedome, power,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20.</note> good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and mercie, &amp;c. and ſo in the ſight and feeling of the ſame, we may reioyce much more: eſpecially, when we haue prayed to God for them, we may reioyce, that God hath heard our prayers. And ſo we may deſire God to heare vs, that ſo, not onely for his benefits, but for his goodneſſe towards vs in them, and eſpecially in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our prayers for them, we may reioyce.<note place="margin">God is willing to bleſſe his people, that they might reioice.</note> Behold then I pray you the wonderfull goodneſſe of our God, who deſireth our ioy and comfort, and giueth vs things to that end, that we might reioyce, and would haue vs aske them of him to that end, as this people doth here. For as among men this often moueth them to heare vs, that we profeſſe to them, and they ſee it alſo, that if they ſhall doe ſo and ſo for vs, we ſhall haue great caſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce and be glad: and whereas now wee for the want of it are in heauineſſe and ſorrow, this will cheere vp our hearts. And this is ſufficient to moue them that are of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7191:109"/> any good diſpoſition, that in doing for them that are in need, we ſee that we ſhall make them and theirs right glad: and the poore when they ſue to them, they vſe this as a reaſon, and it is accepted. Then may we vrge this vnto the Lord much more, and we may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that it will moue him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">As parents are willing to doe good to their children to that end.</note>For ſo good is the Lord to all that are his, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth not in their ſorow and griefe, no more than pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents doe in the griefe of their children: nay a great deale leſſe, by how much his loue infinitely without all degree of compariſon exceedeth the naturall loue of the moſt tender parents. Therefore as they are willing to doe any thing for them, when they ſee their children ſad and heauie, to cheere them vp; and the very bowels of the mother yearneth vpon them, to bring them out of their heauineſſe; ſo doth the Lord God, of his infit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion, in whom that is ſea-full, whereof we haue but one drop. And we may deſire of him our comfort, and the meanes of our comfort, and therefore pray that he would giue vs this, and that, according to our particular need, euen that we might reioyce: whereas now and and without them we are full of griefe. Therefore if a man be in feare of ſome trouble (as theſe were of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) which maketh him ſad, at the leaſt he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, as he would: he may pray to God (as theſe doe) and ſay, <hi>O Lord heare mee and helpe me,</hi>

From whence wee may learne how we ought to be affected with the common benefits of our time:<note place="margin">We ought to reioyce in the common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of our time.</note> as here they ſpeake of publicke bleſsing, namely, victorie ouer their enemies, and ſo of common peace and tranquilitie that ſhould follow; namely, that we ſhould take them from God, as matter of great ioy. And as when there is any common afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and plague in the land, of what kind ſoeuer, wee ſhould be affected with it, and be ſorrowfull for it: and not haue that ſtonineſſe and hardneſſe of heart that is in too many, whereby it ſhould come to paſſe, that wee ſhould make light of ſuch things, and not be mooued with them, as we ought. So we ſhould be touched with the conſideration of the common benefits, to reioice in them, becauſe we haue our part in them: and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that thoſe benefits be, the more ſhould we reioyce in them, and the more ſhould be our ioy for them: or elſe we cannot be ſo thankefull vnto God for them, as we ought. VVee ſhould not then be ſo careleſſe, that we ſhould not marke the common benefits of our time; nor ſo blockiſh and hard hearted, that in marking of them,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7191:111"/> we ſhould not reioyce in them. For we ſee, that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God in their ſeuerall ages and times, haue not onely greatly reioyced in the common benefits of the Church and Commonwealth, wherein they haue had their part with the reſt of their brethren; but they haue openly profeſſed it, to the glorie of God, and the good example of others: As when they returned from the captiuitie of Babylon, where they had beene long, not onely in a ſtrange countrey, but vnder idolaters; now, when they come home, and haue the freedome of their conſcience in Gods ſeruice, and that in their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, they were not onely filled with ioy, but they ſpeak of it among themſelues to their mutuall comfort: and as when they went out, they wept, and were touched with the common miſerie of that time, and put away all tokens of ioy from them.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>That when the Lord brought againe the captiuitie of Sion, they were like them that dreame:</hi> ſo their ioy was ſo great, that they ſay, <hi>Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with ioy:</hi> and they ſay, <hi>The Lord hath done great things for vs, whereof we reioyce.</hi> The Lord hath vouchſafed vs and our forefathers the like mercie, in deliuering vs long ago from the tyrannie of the Pope,<note place="margin">As that we are deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poperie.</note> and of his idolatrie, and giuen vs this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the goſpell in our owne countrey: we muſt ſo conſider of it, That as thoſe holy men that wanted it, ſo prayed for it, that they might reioyce (as this people doth here, for another benefit:) ſo now we that haue it, might reioyce in it indeed, and not to be ſo ſenceleſſe and void of feeling, as many are, not at all or very little to be mooued with ſo great cauſe of ioy.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of all other common benefits whatſoeuer: as when <hi>Salomon</hi> was appointed to be king
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7191:112"/> in his father <hi>Dauids</hi> roome, and this was done with the common conſent of all the nobles and chiefe men of the realme, it is ſaid, they gaue thankes vnto God, and were exceedingly glad.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.20.</note> For <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid vnto them, <hi>Now bleſſe the Lord your God: and all the congregation bleſsed the Lord God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worſhipped the Lord, and the king. And they did eat and drinke before the Lord the ſame day with great ioy: and they made Salomon the ſonne of Dauid king the ſecond time.</hi> So this great benefit, to haue one good prince to ſucceed another peaceably,<note place="margin">And then wee haue one good prince to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed another.</note> was vnto them matters of great ioy. In which reſpect we haue no leſſe cauſe to reioyce than they, that after the death of our late Soueraigne Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of bleſſed memorie, by whom we did enioy many great benefits, who did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore religion, and tooke order for the ſeruice &amp; ſeruants of the Lord (as <hi>Dauid</hi> did) we haue one in Gods great mercie to ſucceed, that maintaineth the Goſpell: and that he is peaceably come to the Crowne (as <hi>Salomon</hi> was then) ſo that neither we are fallen into the hands of our enemies, nor giuen vp vnto Popiſh idolatrie (as both of them were greatly feared.) But as this benefit was greatly deſired of many before, and they thought that then they would reioice, and otherwiſe they could not: ſo we that enioy it, muſt reioyce in it, and ſo conſider of the greatneſſe of it, that our hearts may be made glad with it: and that wee may eat and drinke before the Lord, and vſe other of his benefits, as in his preſence, with great ioy. So is it ſaid afterwards in the dayes of this <hi>Salomon,</hi> when he had builded and made an end of the temple of the Lord, and had with ſolemne prayers and ſacrifices dedicated it vnto his ſeruice, all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the land that came vp to Ieruſalem to the dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that houſe (when all things were finiſhed) <hi>The king ſent away into their tents ioyous and with glad hearts,</hi>

                  <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the goodneſſe that the Lord had done for Dauid, and for Salomon, and for Iſrael his people.</hi> Thus they reioyced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7191:112"/> in this great bleſsing, that God had ſet vp the place to his worſhip among them, ſo that all knew whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reſort vnto it: In regard whereof we haue as great cauſe to reioyce at this time, as they had then; for God hath giuen vs his holy word and Goſpell, and we haue publike places appointed euery where,<note place="margin">And that the Goſpell is planted euery where.</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we &amp; all the people may reſort with the freedome of our conſciences to ſerue God, and we are not by the grace of God vnprouided for this way: let vs doe as this people did here, conſider of it, as a matter of great ioy. And truly ſo it is, if we doe rightly weigh and eſteeme of it: for what I pray you, would our forefathers haue giuen, to inioy theſe great benefits that we doe? and how comfortable would they haue thought their times to haue bene, in reſpect of that they were then, if they might haue had them, as wee haue? I meane, this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and freedome from perſecution: this good gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and peaceable inioying of all that we haue, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the puritie of the Goſpell, and the peace of the Church. And if any one of them ſeuerally be ſufficient cauſe of ioy, then all of them together a great deale more: let vs then ſeeing we haue them, not looſe the comfort of them, but ſo eſteeme of them, and ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them as cauſes of great ioy, as in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they are.</p>
               <p>And as we ought to doe thus at all times, ſo eſpecially and moſt of all, we had need to doe it in the time of any ſorrow or griefe, that thereby we might beare the ſame ſo much the more eaſely, when in ſo many great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits we ſhall ſee what great ioy we haue.<note place="margin">In the time of ſorrow moſt of al we ought to reioice in Gods benefits</note> And truly if we could come to this, as we ought, we ſhould find, that though many times for this and that, and ſuch things as doe befall vs, we haue cauſe to ſorrow; yet for theſe and ſuch like we haue againe cauſe of ioy: and ſo it might happily come to paſſe, that we ſetting the one againſt the other, we might eaſily ouercome at the leaſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7191:113"/> of griefe, and find fault with our ſelues for being grieued too much,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal</hi> 42.11.</note> and ſay as <hi>Dauid</hi> did to himſelfe, <hi>Why art thou caſt downe my ſoule? and why art thou diſquieted within me? wait on God, for I will yet giue him thankes, he is my preſent helpe, and my God.</hi> So we might ſay to our ſelues, why am I thus grieued? haue I not theſe and theſe cauſes of ioy? And ſo though all griefe be not taken cleane away from vs, yet at the leaſt it ſhould by this be ſo moderated and mitigated, as the furious ſpirit of <hi>Saul</hi> was with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant muſicke of <hi>Dauid,</hi> that it might be tollerably and in ſome good ſort borne.<note place="margin">So ſhall our ſorrow be the more eaſily borne.</note> VVhen as it ſhould be with vs, as it was with them that built the ſecond Temple at Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, where ſome wept, and ſome reioyced, and ſo among the people there was ioy and ſorrow mingled together. <hi>Many of the Priests and of the Leuites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſra.</hi> 3.12.</note> 
                  <hi>and of the chiefe fathers, auncient men, which had ſeene the first houſe (when the foundation of this houſe was layd before their eyes) wept with a loud voice, and many ſhouted aloud for ioy: So that the people could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the ſound of the ſhout for ioy, from the noiſe of the weeping of the people; for the people ſhouted with a loud cry, and the noyſe was heard far off.</hi> Some here wept becauſe they had no more, and ſome reioyced becauſe they had ſo much; and they could not tell which of them was the greateſt, the noyſe of them that mourned, or the noyſe of them that reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. So it might come to paſſe that in the middeſt of our ſorrow there might be ſome ioy: and our ioy might be as great as our griefe; and ſo much the greater, by how much the cauſe of the one is greater than the other: and thus when we began to be ſorowfull, we might alſo begin to reioyce. For it is ſaid in a ſong of one of the confeſſors of the Church (who deſired to haue bene a Martyr) Some men for ſudden ioy doe weepe, and ſome in ſorrow ſing, &amp;c. Betwixt them both (ſaith he) will I begin, &amp;c. meaning, that he would ſo ſorrow for his ſinnes, that he would reioyce in Chriſt, in whom he ſaw more cauſe to reioyce, than he could ſee of ſorrow in
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7191:113"/> himſelfe: and ſo he would begin betweene both, and that did make a very good meane. So muſt wee doe, think as well what cauſe we haue of ioy, as we do of our ſorrow; &amp; ſo neither reioyce without ſorrow when there is cauſe, nor ſorrow without ioy, when there is cauſe of both, but as he ſaid, begin betweene both.</p>
               <p>And let vs be willing to do thus the rather, becauſe few haue any care at all to doe it, as they ought: whereby it commeth to paſſe that they looſe the fruits and comfort of theſe benefits:<note place="margin">Few do truly reioyce in Gods benefits.</note> and though they haue them, yet they are not ſo comfortable vnto them, as they might be. For theſe things that we haue ſpoken of, namely, the common benefit of peace, and good gouernment, and the Goſpell, are common to all in our time, as well as to our ſelues: but how few doe truely reioyce before the Lord in them? or in the cauſes of their ioy, doe at any time thinke or conſider of them? or when they would make themſelues merry, do enter into the ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of theſe cauſes of ioy? but what is the cauſe of it? Surely they neither haue prayed vnto God for them (as this people did here for this that they ſpeake of) neither haue they eſteemed of them, as of great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits (as they did of this, that they prayed for) and ſo they cannot reioyce in them, as they ſhould: and by that meanes alſo it commeth to paſſe, that they cannot be ſo thankfull to God for them, as they ought, and as others are. For theſe two goe together, and cannot be ſeuered; To reioyce in Gods benefits, and to be thankefull for them: ſo that the more we reioyce, the more thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſhould we be: and the want of ioy in Gods benefits, is the cauſe of vnthankefulneſſe for them. As wee ſee here alſo, that in this verſe they are ioyned together, when they ſay, <hi>That we might reioyce in thy ſaluation, and ſet vp our banners in the name of our God:</hi> as we ſhall hereafter ſee by the grace of God, out of theſe words, VVhat ſhould be the fruit of all true ioy in Gods benefits (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7191:114"/> this ioy of the holy Ghoſt differeth from all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and worldly ioy) euen thankeſgiuing to God, who hath beſtowed them vpon vs, and in them hath giuen vs ſo great cauſe of ioy.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">All priuat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ioy.</note>And as all common benefits are cauſes of ioy, euen as this people profeſſe here, That if God beſtow this vpon them, they ſhall reioyce in it: ſo are alſo all priuat bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings ſo many cauſes of ioy to all thoſe that enioy them: whether they bee vpon their ſoules or bodies, for this life or the life to come, vpon themſelues or any of theirs. And as the things, that they inioy, are more and greater than others haue, ſo they ought to confeſſe, that God hath in this vale of miſerie giuen them ſo much cauſe of ioy. For who is he or ſhe, or where are they, that being in neuer ſo meane an eſtate, doe not inioy many great benefits from God? as life, and health, libertie, conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient food, lodging, rayment, for which they haue cauſe to reioyce:<note place="margin">In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt hath great cauſe of ioy.</note> but eſpecially if they haue faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and the peace of conſcience, and aſſurance of the forgiueneſſe of their ſinnes, and hope of ſaluation, what cauſe haue they then to reioyce, though they were in neuer ſo great want beſides?

So that as the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaid to his ſeruant, who was in great feare, and cried out, when he ſaw the great hoſt of armed men which the king of Aram had ſent,<note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 6.16.</note> to take them at Dotham, <hi>Feare not, for there are more with vs, than against vs:</hi> (for God had ſent horſes and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots of fire to defend them.) So euerie one may ſay, when his eſtate is at the hardeſt, that there is more with him, than is againſt him: that is, that he hath more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and ſo more cauſes of ioy, than croſſes, and ſo in them cauſes of ſorrow. For if we doe but liue eſpecially in theſe dayes to ſerue God, and to ſaue our own ſoules,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7191:114"/> it is better than the eſtate of many nobles and princes in other parts of the world, that haue not theſe meanes of their ſaluation that we haue and may haue, and in that meaſure, and with that peace and freedome that we haue them: in which reſpect, the eſtate of the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt is better, if they doe ſee it, and can ſo conſider of it, than not onely of many nobles, but of the great Turke himſelfe, &amp; of the Emperor, yea, the Pope himſelfe, who taketh himſelfe to be king &amp; prince of the whole world.

And thus the more cunning you are, and the more you can doe, the better harmonie ſhall you make to your ſelfe and others; that is, the more you ſhall reioyce euen then, when to the worldward you haue cauſe of nothing but ſorrow.<note place="margin">

So ſhall not onely your ſelues haue comfort, but God ſhall haue prayſe: and for want of this wiſe conſideration of both, neither haue you ioy in your ſelues, nor God honour from you in that eſtate, though he hath giuen you ſufficient cauſe of both.</p>
               <p>And as for the rich, what great cauſe of ioy they haue in the multitude of ſo many great benefits as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy, (of whom it may be truly ſaid, as the Apoſtle ſaith of the Gentiles,<note place="margin">

So that in ſuch an eſtate as many are in, if they cannot reioyce, but liue in heauineſſe, and diſcontentedly, whereby they can
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:7191:115"/> neither ſerue God ſo cheerefully, nor praiſe him ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, as they ſhould; they are altogether vnworthie of all. I need not therefore ſay any thing to them, their owne eyes and hands, their backes and their bellies can tell them ſufficiently, what cauſe they haue to reioyce:<note place="margin">What cauſe the rich haue to liue ioyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably.</note> their apparrell and their clothing, wherewith they are kept from cold, when others goe halfe naked &amp; quake for cold, their food in aboundance, and of the beſt, both for neceſsitie and delight; when others are pinched with hunger, haue but bread and drinke, and not ynough of that, who themſelues and their children do eat by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and by weight, to draw out their food at length: their ſoft and warme lodging, when others lie hard and cold, and ſcarcely can be warme all night. Theſe and many things els can put them in mind, from day to night, and from night to day, what great cauſe they haue to reioyce aboue many others. Let them then in the name of God ſo conſider of them, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce; for God hath giuen them to them to that end: as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith in the booke of the Preacher,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccle.</hi> 2.24.</note> 
                  <hi>That this is the fruit of all that a man can haue of all that he hath, to eat and to drinke, and to reioyce in the bleſsings of God:</hi> and yet that alſo is the gift of God, as he confeſſeth there. Therefore they aboue all others muſt confeſſe, that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them great cauſe of ioy: and nothing can ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall them (vnleſſe God take all away from them, as hee did from <hi>Iob</hi>) but they muſt needs acknowledge, that ſtill they haue cauſe to reioice. So that it is not onely lawfull for them, in and for theſe to reioice, but it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie that they ſhould doe ſo, and it is required at their hands; inſomuch, that if they were ſo blind, that they would not confeſſe, that they had great cauſe of ioy, all men would by the benefits which they enioy in great number, witneſſe againſt them: and if they were ſo froward, that they would not reioice, all men would condemne them for it. And thus we ſee, that all ſorts
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:7191:116"/> in reſpect of Gods benefits which he hath beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, haue cauſe to reioice.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The prayſe of God muſt be the fruit of our ioy.</note>But what is to be done in this ioy, and for all theſe cauſes of ioy? it followeth in the next words of the text on this wiſe, <hi>And ſet vp our banners in the name of our God,</hi> that is, praiſe God for them: for we ſee here how they are ioyned together, <hi>That we may reioice in thy ſaluation, and ſet vp our banners in the name of the Lord our God.</hi> So they ſay, that this ſhould be the fruit of their ioy, they would praiſe God in it, for the cauſe of it. And this ought to be the fruit of true ioy in all men and for all things. For as all good and godly ſorrow ſhould driue vs vnto prayer, that God might turne that away from vs, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue it, for which we doe ſorrow: ſo on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, all true and godly ioy ſhould driue vs to thankesgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for that, which is the cauſe of our ioy. And as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, godly and wordly ſorrow differ, that the one many times driueth to deſpaire, or cauſeth ſickneſſe, and ſo death in the end;<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10.</note> the other <hi>cauſeth repentance, neuer to bee repented of;</hi> and ſo prayer to God for the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, which haue iuſtly brought vpon vs that cauſe of ſorrow. So on the other ſide, herein godly ioy diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from worldly ioy; the one, maketh a man ſecure, and to forget God, and to reſt in himſelfe, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be prophane, and to keep no meaſure in things, but to abuſe that that he hath: but the other inlargeth the heart to praiſe God, and maketh him to goe out of the things themſelues, the cauſes of his ioy, vnto God, the author of them. And thus doth the Apoſtle very excellently by theſe fruits note out vnto vs true ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,<note place="margin">

And S. <hi>Paule</hi> doth ſhew vs at large the difference betweene the worldly ioy of the wicked, and the godly ioy of the

                  <note place="margin">And therein true ioy diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from all worldly ioy.</note> 
                  <hi>giuing thankes alwaies for all things vnto God, euen the father, in the name of our Lord Ieſus Christ:</hi> wherein one kind (as in feaſting) which is lawfull, and common to the good and bad, and which is an honeſt means to make men merry and glad, hee ſheweth the diuerſitie of the mirth of the one and of the other. The men of this world they exceed, and fall into the abuſe of Gods creatures, ſometimes till they be drunken, or haue ſurfeited, and ſo alſo giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto that mirth which is exceſsiue and immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, and ſometimes, yea commonly, ioyned with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane ſcoffing or ſome wickedneſſe. The children of God vſing his creatures ſoberly, and in his preſence, euen at their feaſts, doe thereby prouoke one another to prayſe God, and make themſelues merry in God, and as in his ſight. VVee ſee then what ſhould be the fruit of our ioy in Gods benefits, namely, the prayſe of God; and to what end alſo hee giueth to vs ſo many things wherein we may reioyce, euen that he might haue the whole glorie and prayſe of them. So that whether we be poore, or we be rich, haue we more, or haue we leſſe to reioyce in, this muſt be the fruit of all, that we praiſe God for ſuch things as make vs to reioyce. And ſo as there is none in the world, but hee hath ſome cauſe of ioy, ſo the Lord looketh for continuall prayſe at the hands of vs all: but, as many haue more cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce than others,<note place="margin">Thus all haue cauſe to praiſe God.</note> by reaſon of the manifold bleſsings which they enioy aboue them; ſo he looketh for more prayſe and thankes at their hands, than of others, as there is good cauſe: <hi>For to whom much is giuen, of them much ſhall be required.</hi> VVhich if they doe not labour to performe, and profit by Gods benefits, and by their ioy in them to that end, it may come to paſſe, that the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:7191:117"/> may haue as much ioy in the things that they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe, as themſelues; yea, the very vnreaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the brute beaſts in their kind: for if our ioy end not in the prayſe of God, what are we better for it than they? Therefore it is not ynough for a man to ſay, I liue merrily, and at my hearts eaſe, I haue many cauſes of ioy, I am void of ſorrow and griefe, I haue nothing that doth trouble me, but am in continuall mirth: it is not ynough (I ſay) to be in this eſtate, and thus to boaſt, and ſay; but we muſt labour to be thankefull vnto God for it, who is the cauſe of it, &amp; let our ioy in theſe things lead vs vnto him: then ſhall it appeare in truth, that our ioy is not ſo much carnall as ſpirituall, not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worldly, but heauenly.</p>
               <p>Thus haue the ſeruants of God behaued themſelues in time paſt in the midſt of their ioy: as that good king <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> and his people, when God gaue them victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ouer their enemies according to their prayer, euen ouer that great hoaſt of the Ammonites and the Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, and thoſe of mount Seir, of whom it is thus written,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20 25.</note> 
                  <hi>That they deſtroyed one another. So that when Iudah came to Mizpeh in the wilderneſſe, they looked vnto the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The godly haue ended their greateſt ioy with tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.</note> 
                  <hi>and behold the carkaſſes were fallen on the earth, and none eſcaped: and when Iehoſhaphat and his people came to take the ſpoile of them, they found among them in abundance both of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and alſo of bodies laden with pretious iewels, which they tooke for themſelues, till they could cary no longer: for they were three dayes in gathering of the spoile, for it was much. Then eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man of Iudah and Ieruſalem returned with Iehoſhaphat their head, to goe againe to Ieruſalem with ioy, for the Lord had made them to reioyce ouer their enemies.</hi> Thus they reioyced great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as they had cauſe, both for the victory, and for the ſpoile: but what followed vpon that? the praiſe of God: for it is ſaid in the verſe going before, That in the fourth day they aſſembled themſelues in the valley of Bera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chah; for there they bleſſed the Lord: therefore they
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:7191:117"/> called the name of the place, the valley of Berachah, that is, of bleſsing or prayſing of God, vnto this day. So that as their ioy was great, ſo was their thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing and praiſe to God, great and famous, ſo that the place had the name of it. And they did not tarrie vntill they came home to Ieruſalem to giue thankes there, which yet it is moſt like that afterwards they did but euen in that place where God gaue them cauſe of ioy, and whileſt that laſted, that they might doe it the better. So we ſee that they practiſed that which is ſpoken of here, they ſo reioyced in the ſaluation that God gaue to the king, and to all the people, <hi>that they did ſet vp their banners in his name,</hi> when he had fulfilled their petitions which they had made vnto him before. So muſt we alſo in all feares that we be in, when God ſhall deliuer vs out of them (as he did theſe) and ſo giue vs cauſe to reioyce, we muſt prayſe his name for it, as they did. As for example, when it ſhall pleaſe God to put an end euery where vnto this great mortalitie of the peſtilence, that hath a long time beene in many places of this land, and is ſtill, then all ſhall haue cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce.<note place="margin">So muſt we do, when God ſhall make vs glad by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away this plague.</note> But as we meet now from weeke to weeke, and from day to day to pray to God for it: ſo muſt wee then meet againe in the valley of Berachah, to prayſe him for it, that is, we muſt publickely and often meet to giue thankes vnto him, and to ſet vp our banners in his name, that hath ſo gratiouſly fulfilled our petitions. And in the meane ſeaſon, looke in how many feares we haue beene in, either of that, or of any other thing, and haue eſcaped it, and ſo now we are glad; we muſt yeeld ſo many prayſes vnto God for the ſame. That vertuous woman <hi>Hannah,</hi> when ſhe had by prayer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the benefit of a ſonne, ſhe greatly reioyced, as ſhe had cauſe, and as ſhe confeſſeth her ſelfe, ſaying: <hi>My ſoule reioyceth in the Lord, my horne is exalted in the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.1.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Before that ſhe was ſad, and wept, and could not
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:7191:118"/> eat her meat, nor hide her griefe, becauſe her barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was reprochfull vnto her: but now ſhe reioyceth, and in this ioy looketh vp to God, and prayſeth him, ſaying, <hi>Mine heart reioyceth in the Lord:</hi> and ſhe maketh a ſong of thankeſgiuing vnto God, as appeareth by the wordes following. So muſt we doe in all the benefits that God beſtoweth vpon vs; I meane, not only reioyce in them as naturall men, but prayſe God for them, as ſpirituall: that ſo our ioy might be ſuch as it ſhould.</p>
               <p>Let vs then conſider in the feare of God, how many times we haue reioyced, and that with exceeding great ioy when, God hath had no praiſe nor thanks from vs at all: &amp; know aſſuredly, that that ioy hath not bin rightly ordered; for God doth make vs reioice, not for our ſelues alone, but for himſelfe alſo: yea principally that he might be prayſed for it. Therefore we muſt be carefull that theſe two goe together alwayes, namely, our owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing, and the prayſe of God. As the bleſſed virgin <hi>Marie</hi> doth ioyne them together in her ſong,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 1.56.</note> 
                  <hi>My ſoule magnifieth the Lord, and my spirit reioyceth in God my Sauiour:</hi> where ſhe ioyneth her owne ioy with the praiſe of God, and maketh the one the cauſe of the other. So that whether wee ioy in the common benefits of our time, wee muſt prayſe God for them, as <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> and his people did; or wee reioyce in our priuat benefits, as <hi>Hannah</hi> and <hi>Marie</hi> did, we muſt prayſe God for them: ſo ſhall our ioy be not onely comfortable to our ſelues,<note place="margin">Our ioy and Gods prayſe ſhould goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note> but acceptable vnto God, and profitable vnto others: when as the more benefits that we haue, the more we reioyce: and the more we reioyce, the more thankefull are we to God for the ſame. VVe doe not therefore find fault with myrth, we forbid not men to be merry; be it farre from vs, that we ſhould be ſo Stoicall &amp; ſeuere; nay we exhort all men to it, and ſhew that they ought, when God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them cauſe: only that kind of myrth is condemned in the Scripture, which tendeth to the diſhonour of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:7191:118"/> God, or when they fall into exceſſe: or they cannot be merry, but they will be mad alſo, as we ſay, ſo that they throw firebrands and deadly things, and ſay,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>They are but in ſport,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh of them: or that kind of myrth, wherein God hath no prayſe at all; which is the beſt kind of myrth that the wicked, and men of this world haue. VVe allow of that, wherein God is prayſed, and of that onely: for though we be not bound in all our myrth to ſing Pſalmes, neither indeed can we; yet after all our myrth, both for it, and for all cauſes of it, we ſhould giue thankes vnto God. But many are ſo farre from this, that they reioyce in ſuch things, for which they cannot prayſe God, yea for ſuch, which it is ſhame once to name; whom we leaue vnto God, that he may giue them better minds: &amp; others, though they haue cauſe of honeſt and lawfull ioy, yet they forget to be thankefull for it; for whom let vs pray alſo, and for our ſelues, that we may ſo reioyce in all Gods benefits and ordinances, &amp; ſo vſe them with ioy, that he may be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for them.

                  <hi>For we know</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>that kings and princes are miniſters of God for our wealth:</hi> that is, they are called of God vnto thoſe high places, not for themſelues, but for the good of the people: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in their ſaluation we muſt reioyce, for it is ioyned with our owne wealth. And Saint <hi>Paule</hi> vnto <hi>Timothie</hi> ſheweth this point more fully,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.3.</note> when he ſaith, <hi>That vnder them we lead a peaceable and quiet life, with all honeſty and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi> This benefit then we get by them, when they be good, we liue by their good gouernment, peaceably, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and godlily: which are three great benefits, and without the which our life were no life: therefore we muſt pray for them,<note place="margin">In this reſpect they ought to pray for his life.</note> that by them we might inioy theſe great benefits, and ſo reioyce in his preſeruation by whoſe meanes we doe inioy them. For if the prince miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carie any waies, we are in danger to leeſe all our wealth, yea peace, and all honeſt and godly liuing.

                  <hi>In thoſe dayes there was no king in Iſrael, but euery man did that which was good in his eyes:</hi> Thus would it be with vs, and with all people, euery man would do that, that ſeemed good in his owne eyes: and then what confuſion
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:7191:119"/> and diſorder would there be in the world? what peace, what godlineſſe, or what honeſtie could there be among men? And this is not once but three times at the leaſt ſet downe in that booke; in the beginning, middeſt, and endding of two notable and famous ſtories, which ſhew what kind of life was then amongſt them, euen ſuch as was neither peaceable and quiet, nor honeſt, nor godly. The one is of the Leuits concubine abuſed and oppeſſed euen vnto death; &amp; the other is of that idolatrie which began in the houſe of <hi>Micah,</hi> and ſo did ſpread it ſelfe ouer the whole tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> and of the reſt; beſides that, the Leuites and miniſters of God were neglected then, and not ſufficiently prouided for: in the narration of which, this is often interlaced as a graue ſentence, ſhewing the cauſe of all that diſorder: <hi>In thoſe dayes there was no king or ſupreame gouernour in Iſrael, and ſo euery man did that, which was good in his owne eyes:</hi> as if it had beene ſayd, Surely if they had had any good gouernour among them, and namely, one chiefe to ouerſee and rule the reſt, theſe abuſes had neuer broken out, or if they had, they ſhould neuer haue growen to ſuch an head. Beſides this, where there is a continuall ſucceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of kings, yet euen in the change of them to death, without a ſpeciall grace and bleſsing of God, there is great daunger of chaunge in the ſtate of the people. Therefore all people had need to pray for the life, health, &amp; preſeruation of their kings, that ſo themſelues might reioyce, as they doe here.</p>
               <p>And for proofe of this, we may eaſily conceiue how the people of Iſrael did flouriſh, and abound in all things in the dayes of king <hi>Solomon,</hi> by that which is written of them: he was a peaceable prince, and ſo the people had peace and wealth,<note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 4.25. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.27.</note> 
                  <hi>For euery man did ſit quietly vnder his vine and vnder his figge tree, and none did raiſe them vp:</hi> and in his dayes ſiluer was as plentifull as the ſtones in the ſtreet, and Cedar in as great abundance as the wild
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7191:120"/> figge trees which grow abundantly in the plaine: and ſuch almoſt was our caſe all the dayes of our renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and worthie Queene <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> for wee had peace, and wealth, with the Goſpell alſo, in great abundance. But when <hi>Salomon</hi> died,<note place="margin">For in the death of the prince there is great feare of alteration to the ſtate.</note> what great alteration was there in the kingdome of Iſrael? when his ſonne <hi>Rehoboham</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the auntient counſellors of his father, and choſe new in their roome, like to himſelfe: whereupon there grew a faction and diuiſion, firſt among the nobles, and then among the reſt of the people: ſo that ten parts of his people fell cleane away from him, &amp; from God too, euen to idolatrie, and to the golden calues in Dan and Bethel: ſo that there was much warre betweene them, and bloodſhed among them. Now when all this fell out, how did they ſee by experience, that they had cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to pray for the life of <hi>Salomon</hi> their king, as the chiefe and onely cauſe of their welfare and ioy? So we in like manner had great cauſe in this reſpect to pray for the life of our Queene, as we did, to preſerue her both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt forraine inuaſions intended, and alſo ſecret trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and practiſes at home: for in her life we had great cauſe of ioy. And in all deliuerances of her from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger (which were many and great) wee had cauſe ſtill to reioyce: and ſo in her long life we did enioy the fruit of our prayers, for we did ſo much the more and longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in her, and in all benefits which wee enioyed by her: and we had iuſt cauſe to feare, that in her death we ſhould haue had more cauſe of ſorrow, than by the grace and mercie of God we had. But now we would be loath to haue any more changes on the ſudden, and therefore we are to pray earneſtly vnto God for this our Soueraigne King, <hi>Iames,</hi> by the grace of God king of England, Scotland, Fraunce, and Ireland, defendor of the true auntient, Catholicke, and Apoſtolicke faith, and in all cauſes, as well Eccleſiaſticall as Ciuill, and ouer all perſons within theſe his realmes and dominions, next
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:7191:120"/> and immediatly vnder Chriſt Ieſus ſupreme gouernour and iugde: we are to pray for his life, and for the life of the Queene, the Prince, and all their noble and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ofspring: and for his maieſties perſon, that God would ſaue him from his enemies (as we ſee, that he hath not wanted ſome in this ſhort time of his raigne) that we might ſtill reioyce. And we muſt be thus perſuaded, that his ſaluation ſhall be ſtill our ioy, as this people doth thus here thinke of <hi>Dauid</hi> their king. Therefore as we deſire the continuance of our ioy and comfort, ſo let vs ſtill pray for the preſeruation of his moſt excellent maieſtie, the meanes and cauſe of it.</p>
               <p>For that which is ſayd of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the king of Babylon, is true of all good kings, and namely of our ſoueraigne Lord King <hi>Iames</hi> moſt of all,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>He was like a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great tree, whoſe bowes were faire, and the fruit thereof much, and it was meat for all: it made a ſhadow vnder it for the beasts of the field, and the foules of the heauen dwelt in the branches thereof, and all fleſh fed of it.</hi> So doe we vnder his gratious gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inioy defence and protection from all enemies, iniuries and wrongs, and it is as a ſhadow to vs againſt the ſcorching heat of the ſunne: and by his meanes we peaceably inioy the vſe of all that we haue, both for meat and drinke, and all things needfull for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of this life, and ſo we (as it were) feed of his fruit. Therefore we had need ſtill to pray for his preſeruation, not onely that all theſe great benefits might be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, but that we might ſtill reioyce in them, as now we doe: and let vs be perſuaded, that as long as God ſhall preſerue him out of the handes of his enemies, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long his life, ſo long ſhall we haue cauſe to reioyce. VVhat ſhall we thinke then of them that haue ſought not the preſeruation, but the vtter ruine and finall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow of their naturall princes, kings, and Queenes? as wee haue had too great experience of it in this land, both in the dayes of our late good Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:7191:121"/> eſpecially, and alſo in this ſhort time of our now worthy king <hi>Iames:</hi> we muſt needs iudge of them not onely as traitours to their perſons, but as common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to all the people of this land; in that they haue ſought to bereaue vs and them of the chiefeſt cauſe of our ioy,<note place="margin">Traytors are enemies to the common ioy.</note> and ſo to caſt vs into vntimely ſorrow. For as there was great lamentation among the Iewes, and not without cauſe,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.24 25.</note> at the death of that good and godly king <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> ſo that <hi>Ieremie</hi> the Prophet trembled alſo, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be the chiefe mourner: ſo had we no leſſe cauſe to lament at the death of our noble &amp; vertuous Queene, and the miniſters of the Goſpell moſt of all, and all the vnfained profeſſors of the ſame; and ſhould haue had a great deale more, if ſhe had beene traitorouſly taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way before the full number of her dayes were expired, to the great diſturbance of the whole Realme, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the deſperat and continual attempts of her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And ſo ſhould we now ſtill haue, if any ſuch thing ſhould be offered vnto his maieſties perſon. Therefore we muſt iudge of them, as of our greateſt enemies, who ſeeke to bring vpon vs a common ſorrow before the time. But let vs lift vp, though not our hands, yet our voice againſt them, &amp; pray vnto God ſtill to diſappoint them of their treaſonable deuiſes and diuelliſh practiſes, and to preſerue our king, and all his, that ſo we may ſtill reioyce in their ſaluation, euen for Chriſt Ieſus his ſake.</p>
               <q>In thy ſaluation, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>As all ſubiects principally ſhould by this example learne to pray for their kings, and all chiefe gouernours vnder them, That God would preſerue and bleſſe them, that they might the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues reioyce, becauſe they be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy inſtruments of Gods goodneſſe vnto them; which is the thing that hath bin handled alreadie: ſo all inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours may here ſee as in a glaſſe, what minds they ſhould carry to all their ſuperiours, &amp; thoſe that God hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in any roume, of what kind ſo euer they be; that they
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:7191:121"/> ſhould bee perſuaded, that in their preſeruation and welfare conſiſteth their owne ioy and comfort:<note place="margin">All inferiors ſhould count the welfare of their ſuperiors their own ioy.</note> and that they cannot miſcarrie, or any ill befall them, but them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues muſt needs be ſorrowfull, and in that reſpect pray for them continually, be they neuer ſo meane. As with this mind &amp; perſuaſion the people ſhould pray for their miniſter's and teachers, <hi>who watch for their ſoules,</hi>

                  <hi>the ſheepe will be ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered:</hi> that is, when God taketh them away, who are their guiders, the people are in daunger to fall into all kind of error, hereſie, and ſinne, and to be diſtracted &amp; ſcattered among themſelues, not onely in iudgement but in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: beſides, they may want the comfort of Gods word, and of their praiers. So ſhould all children be affected to their naturall parents, fathers &amp; mothers; and alſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to their maſters and gouernours: That ſeeing God hath placed them ouer them for their good, and they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy ſo many great benefis in their houſes, and by their meanes, and ſo haue ſo many cauſes of reioycing from them &amp; by them, they ſhould pray for their liues, health, and welfare, that they may reioyce there ſtill, for they ſhall haue their part in it, and it ſhall bee the better for them.

                  <hi>His ſonne fell vpon his fathers face, &amp; wept:</hi> &amp; ſo he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued mourning for him a long time: &amp; at his buriall there was ſuch great mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for him, that the place had the name of it. And <hi>Eſau</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Izack,</hi> though he was a wicked &amp; diſobedient child, as appeareth in his ſtorie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb</hi> 12.16.</note> yea a <hi>prophane perſon</hi> (as the holy Ghoſt calleth him) yet he had ſo much grace in him (as we ſay) that hee thinketh of his fathers death before hand, as of a time of ſorrow and mourning, and ſo ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:7191:122"/> of it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gene.</hi> 27.41.</note> ſaying, <hi>The dayes of mourning for my father will come ſhortly,</hi> that is, my father is old and will ſhortly die, and then I muſt mourne for him: which though hee ſpake with an ill mind, and to an ill end, (for in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of his brother <hi>Iaakob</hi> he comforted himſelfe, that he might ſhortly kill him, when his father was dead) yet nature, &amp; the good education which he had, had taught him to confeſſe, that when his father died, he ſhould haue cauſe to mourne. Therefore if there were no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God to bind them vnto it, or any other reaſon to perſuade them, this were ſufficient to mooue them to pray for the life and health of their parents, that themſelues might ſtill reioyce: and not be graceleſſe, as to thinke, that if their fathers were dead, they ſhould be merry, &amp; liue wel ynough, yea better than they do now, &amp; ſo not to care whether they liue or die, yea, to wiſh ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they were dead than aliue; as there are too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch in the world, who in a wrong perſuaſion gape af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their fathers death, as <hi>Abſolon</hi> did: but God can well ynough diſappoint the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their long hope, as he did him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">We ought to pray for the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that we might reioyce therein.</note>But this doctrine is yet more generall, and doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne euery one of vs, and ſheweth that wee ought to beare that affection of brotherly loue all of vs one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, that we ſhould deſire and pray for the good and welfare one of another, not onely, that they themſelues, but that wee might reioyce in that good, which God ſhall beſtow vpon them at our prayers: and if we were thus affected in loue to the good one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then ſhould we pray a great deale more often, and more effectually than we doe. For this is that which the Apoſtle teacheth vnto the Romanes: <hi>Be of like affection one to another,</hi> ſaith he: and how, <hi>reioyce with them that reioyce, and weepe with them that weepe,</hi> where he would haue vs ſo affected with the eſtate of our brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that if God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them, we ſhould reioyce with them; if he afflict and puniſh them any way, we ſhould ſorrow with them:
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7191:122"/> and ſo we ſhould count their ſorrow and ioy our owne, and therefore when they are in any deſtreſſe, we ſhould pray for their deliuerance, that we might reioyce with them and in them. And truly if we come to pray for our brethren with this affection, (as our ſauiour Chriſt hath taught vs, willing vs to ſay, <hi>Giue vs our daily bread, &amp;c.</hi> ſo that we ſhould pray for others as for our ſelues) we might obtaine great things for them. Therefore when we pray for any, let vs put their eſtate vpon vs, &amp; be moued with it, as though it were our owne, and ſo ſpeake to God for them, as for our ſelues, and thinke, that if God ſhall bleſſe them, we ſhall reioyce. And this meaſure of loue in prayer, the more that we can come vnto, the more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance may we haue, that God will heare vs for them: nay indeed without it we can haue little or none at all, that God will heare vs for any. As for example, if any in their ſickneſſe doe deſire that we ſhould pray for them here in the Church, and we doe ſo: we muſt deſire their health and recouerie, not onely that the partie himſelfe prayed for might reioyce, and his familie, wife, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the reſt of his friends, but that we all might be glad and comforted by his life and health: and we muſt account his recouerie our ioy, and thinke that if God ſhall heare vs for him, we our ſelues ſhall be bound to giue thankes vnto God for it. And when the Lord ſhall ſee, that that will be matter of ioy vnto many, then will he the ſooner beſtow it vpon vs. And thus doth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeake of the ſickeneſſe and of the recouerie of <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> a miniſter of the Goſpell in the Church of Philippi:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.25.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſuppoſed it neceſsarie to ſend him vnto you: for he longed after you all, and was full of heauineſſe, becauſe he had heard that he had beene ſicke: and no doubt hee was ſicke, very neere vnto death: but God had mercie on him, and not on him onely, but on mee alſo, least I ſhould haue ſorrow vpon ſorrow.</hi> Thus if he had died, <hi>Paule</hi> and all the reſt of the Church of God ſhould haue ſorrowed for the loſſe of ſuch a worthy inſtrument
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:7191:123"/> of the glorie of God, therefore they being in great heauineſſe alreadie, God would not by taking him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way increaſe their griefe by this new cauſe of ſorrow; but as they all deſired his life for their further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſo God did rayſe him vp, that they all might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Few pray for their brethren with this affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note>But for the moſt part men are not thus affected with the eſtate of their brethren, no, not when they pray for them: but for want of loue, as if their affliction continue ſtill vpon them, they will not greatly ſorrow for them; ſo if it bee remooued and taken away, they will not greatly reioyce; but it is all one with them, howſoeuer it falleth out with them: and ſo it commeth to paſſe, as it muſt needs, that they pray very coldly, and therefore obtaine very little or nothing for them. And yet our Sauiour Chriſt hath taught vs (as was ſaid euen now) to pray with this affection and fellow-feeling of the eſtate of others, both in ſoule and bodie, where he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded vs to ſay, <hi>Giue vs this day our dayly bread, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue vs our treſpaſſes, and lead vs not into tentation, &amp;c.</hi> So that when we pray for others, we ſhould account their eſtate our owne. But men commonly, through ſelfe-loue, which raigneth in them, are ſo taken vp wholly into their owne eſtate, that they can neither ſorrow nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, nor any wayes bee mooued with any thing, but with that which concerneth themſelues. The Apoſtle writing to the Corinthians, giueth a reaſon of this ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie that ſhould bee among all the true beleeuers, drawne from a compariſon of the parts of the naturall bodie; among which, they all haue the ſame care one for another, and the ſame affection both of ioy and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25.</note> when he ſayth thus: <hi>God hath tempered the bodie toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and hath giuen more honour to that part which lacked, least there ſhould be any diuiſion in the bodie: but that the members ſhould haue the ſame care one for another. Therefore if one member ſuffer, all ſuffer with it.</hi> So ought it to be in the myſticall
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:7191:123"/> bodie of Chriſt, which we are, and euery one of vs mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame, as he ſayth there:<note place="margin">Verſ. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Now yee are the bodie of Christ, and members for your part.</hi> Therefore as when any part of the bodie is pained, all the reſt by a naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct deſire the eaſe of it, not onely for the benefit of it, but for their owne comfort, which otherwiſe cannot be quiet: ſo ſhould we by the motion of Gods ſpirit, much more pray for the eaſe and releaſe of the affliction of our brethren, that we may reioyce. Here then we haue another reaſon to perſuade vs to pray for thoſe that are and haue beene a long time viſited with the peſtilence and the grieuous hand of God,<note place="margin">Wee ſhould pray, that the plague might ceaſe from our brethren, that we might reioyce.</note> for which they are in great heauineſſe and feare night and day; entreating the Lord, that when it hath wrought his good worke in the hearts of all, for which it is ſent, to commaund it to ceaſe, and to take it cleane away: not onely, that their ſorrowfull hearts might be cheered vp and comforted after this long ſorrow, and ſo ſome light might ariſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them after this darkneſſe; but that all we our ſelues, and the reſt of our brethren in all parts of this land, might reioyce in their ſaluation. That ſo we might take into our mouths the words of the Pſalme, which were vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after a great deliuerance: Others ſaid of them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.2.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord hath done great things for them:</hi> but they ſaid, <hi>The Lord hath done great things for vs, whereof we reioyce.</hi> So we ſhould not count our ſelues ſtrangers from our brethren, and from their good, and ſpeake of them as it were aloofe off, when we ſhould heare how the plague is ſtayed in ſuch and ſuch a place, <hi>The Lord hath done great things for them:</hi> but as though it were our owne caſe, ſay, <hi>The Lord hath done great things for vs, whereof we reioyce:</hi> and ſo we to reioyce in their ſaluation; we accounting the good that is done to them, as done to our ſelues. And truly, if all men did thus, it were to be hoped, that God would ſoon heare vs. This affection was in <hi>Paule,</hi> when he wrote vnto <hi>Philemon,</hi> and entreated him for his ſeruant <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> who
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:7191:124"/> had ſtollen ſomething from him, and was come away, and caſt into priſon for it; and <hi>Paule</hi> had conuerted him, and then deſireth him to pardon him, and to receiue him againe, not onely that his poore ſeruant might bee comforted, who was now greatly troubled for his ſinne, but that <hi>Paule</hi> himſelfe might reioyce in this great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing beſtowed vpon him, when he ſayth thus: <hi>yea, brother let me obtaine this pleaſure of thee in the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phile.</hi> 20.</note> 
                  <hi>comfort my bowels in the Lord:</hi> where he entreateth him, that in pardoning and receiuing his ſeruant againe, he would beſtow that great benefit vpon himſelfe, &amp; comfort him in the Lord, for ſo he would account of it: and thus he preuailed for it; and ſo might we with God much more for our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. VVhether then we looke to this viſitation of the peſtilence, or to any other calamitie that our neighbors ſhall be in, we in their preſeruation or deliuerance muſt thinke our ſelues greatly comforted in the Lord, and therefore in all things pray for their good, that wee might reioyce: ſo God may heare vs, if not for their ſakes, yet for our owne. And this is that which we haue to obſerue out of the fifth verſe: it followeth in the next.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the ſixt verſe.</note>Verſ. 6. <hi>Now know I, that the Lord will helpe his annointed, and will heare him from his ſanctuarie, by the mightie power of his right hand.</hi> In this verſe <hi>Dauid</hi> profeſſeth beforehand, that he did beleeue that God would heare him, and would defend him from his enemies according to his prayers (for hee was the authour and penner of this Pſalme.) And in teaching the people thus to pray for him, he would haue them alſo beleeue, that God would heare them concerning theſe requeſts which they made in his behalfe, that ſo they likewiſe might pray in the ſame faith. And this faith of them all, is expreſſed and declared not onely when they ſay, that they did know that God would heare and ſend helpe; but eſpecially and moſt ſignificantly in changing the number. For
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:7191:124"/> whereas in the former verſe they ſpake as a multitude, euen the whole Church together, ſaying, <hi>That wee may reioyce in thy ſaluation, and ſet vp our banners in the name of our God;</hi> where three times they ſpeake in the perſon of many: Here, as though there were but one that prayed, they ſay, <hi>I know:</hi> and this they doe according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of true faith, which is, to applie Gods promiſes and his merciful deliuerances particularly to euery man and woman, and ſo ſay, as it is in our Creed, <hi>I beleeue in God,</hi> and not we beleeue; that is, I am perſuaded that hee is the God not onely of others, but of me. And ſo here, though many did vſe this praier together, yet euery one was to haue this faith in themſelues, that they did know that God would heare them. And what doe they or ſhould they beleeue? That God will helpe his annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that is, their king <hi>Dauid;</hi> ſo called, becauſe he was by the commaundement of God annointed by <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet vnto that office:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.13.</note> and that he would heare his prayers, and graunt his requeſts from his ſanctuarie, that is, from heauen. And thus they beleeue that God would doe, by, or with his right hand; that is, by his great power that he hath in himſelfe, whereby hee is able to doe all things; and by the mightie helpe thereof, that is, that great helpe, which he ſhall and will giue, which none is able to reſiſt. And thus for the further ſtrengthening of their faith, they ſet before their eyes the great power of God, whereby hee is able to defend all thoſe that put their truſt in him, in all dangers whatſoeuer: as alſo in the verſe following they doe by compariſon of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of their enemies more fully expreſſe it, ſaying: <hi>Some trust in chariots, and ſome in horſes, but we will remember the name of the Lord our God:</hi> that is, whereas others did truſt in outward meanes, as chariots, and ſuch like, they did truſt onely in the power and grace of Almightie God.</p>
               <p>This teacheth vs to come ſo prepared vnto prayer,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:7191:125"/> that wee beleeue beforehand, that God will heare our prayers,<note place="margin">We muſt pray in faith, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that God will heare vs.</note> and that we ſhall not pray in vaine, but he will giue vs the thing that we aske.

Therefore as by prayer wee doe ſhew, that we beleeue and hope for the grace promiſed; ſo he that hath not this faith in Gods promiſes, prayeth hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critically, that is, more with his tongue, than with his heart. Seeing then, that Gods promiſe is ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, he would not haue vs ſo to pray, as that we ſhould doubt and call into queſtion, whether wee ſhould bee heard or no. And this he ſheweth by an excellent and very fit compariſon: for as the waues of the ſea are toſſed and carried away; ſo they that beleeue not, both are vnquiet alwaies in their minds, yea though they haue prayed, and are altogether vnworthie to receiue any thing. Therefore when wee come to God in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, let vs beforehand beleeue, that hee will heare vs, and ſo pray in faith, and ſay, as this people doth here, <hi>I know that God will heare and helpe:</hi> ſo ſhall our prayers be
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:7191:127"/> acceptable vnto God, ſo ſhall we receiue that that we aske of him; and ſo ſhall our minds bee pacified and quiet.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Few pray in any aſſurance that God doth heare them:</note>Let vs then examine our ſelues, and ſee whether al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies when we haue come to prayer, we haue had this faith and aſſurance, that God would heare vs and helpe vs: and then we ſhall find, that ſome haue beene ſo farre from it, that they haue neuer once thought of it; but they haue come to prayer, neither knowing any ſuch thing, nor regarding it. And thus haue they done not only in the dayes of ignorance &amp; ſuperſtition, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they held it an error for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to think, that he might be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of any thing from God, though he prayed for it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo earneſtly, and when they prayed in an vnknowne tongue, and ſo knew not themſelues what they ſaid, and therefore could not by prayer haue any aſſurance that they were heard: but alſo in this cleare light of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, many haue and do ſtill both in their priuat prayers, and in theſe publicke, come ſo coldly to God, and as it were for faſhion, that they neither know, nor deſire to know, nor thinke it poſsible to know, that God will hear them. And ſo theſe wauering minded men being vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in their minds, and toſſed too and fro like the waues of the ſea, may be aſſured, <hi>That they ſhall obtaine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God,</hi>

                     <hi>Matth</hi> 17.17.</note> For if the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of our Sauiour Chriſt could doe nothing for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers child poſſeſſed with a deuill, when there was moſt need, becauſe of their vnbeleefe; then ſhall wee alſo for the ſame vnbeleefe of ours obtaine nothing neither for our ſelues nor for others, when there is moſt need. And as on the other ſide hee ſaid againe vnto them, <hi>That all things were poſsible to him that beleeueth,</hi> ſo ſhall we find it to bee true in our ſelues; then when wee pray in faith, it
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:7191:127"/> ſhall be poſsible for vs to obtaine all things according to Gods will, euen thoſe that vnto the vnbeleeuers ſhall ſeeme impoſsible.</p>
               <p>Now though this place of Scripture doth not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly require, to ſhew how wee ſhall come to this faith and aſſurance in prayer, that God will heare it; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther onely that wee ought to haue it, and not to pray without it: yet that I might not leaue this doctrine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, it is neceſſarie to ſay ſomewhat of it.

But becauſe this is wrought in vs by meanes, and our faith is grounded ſpecially and onely vpon the promiſes of God, and all aſſurance of being heard, ariſeth from thence; we muſt know, and beleeue, and meditate vpon them, before we pray, that ſo by them we may be aſſured, that he will heare vs, according to the vndoubted truth of the ſame. And the more that wee can doe thus, the greater aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of being heard ſhall we haue, when we pray vnto God. And beſides this we muſt know, that the ſame aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance is confirmed and encreaſed by our former expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience dayly: ſo that when we haue marked, how God hath at other times and in other things heard vs, we may aſſure our ſelues from thence, that he will doe ſo now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. For as among men, when we haue oftentimes made
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:7191:128"/> triall of a friend in the time of our need, wee goe to them afterwards, as any neceſsitie ſhall be vpon vs, with great confidence, and doubt not before wee come to them, but we ſhall ſpeed, if they haue it: ſo vpon our former experience with the Lord, we ought much more boldly to come vnto him in times of need, who hath not onely promiſed, and ſo is willing, but being almightie, is alſo able, and being true and iuſt in his promiſes, will helpe vs. And according to experience of former times, ſome doe read this text that we haue in hand (although I approoue of the other rather which I haue followed) after this manner: <hi>Now know I that the Lord hath ſaued his annointed, and will heare him from his Sanctuarie:</hi> and ſo they confirme their hope by the time paſt, in that they haue marked the goodneſſe of God towards their king in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him before in other dangers, as he was in many: and ſo doubt not, but that hee will heare them for him now, and ſtill ſaue him. But to returne to that that we ſpake of before, namely, How we ſhal come to this aſſurance of being heard. Firſt of all we are to conſider of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God,<note place="margin">Firſt by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating vpon Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> vpon which our faith muſt be grounded, and which muſt giue vs aſſured knowledge of being heard: we may ſee how to this end the holy Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> did meditate vpon them, to ſtrengthen his faith, and in his prayer did (as it were) put God in mind of them, and comfort himſelfe in hope of them, when he prayed thus: <hi>O God of my father Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 32 9.</note> 
                  <hi>and God of my father Izaack: Lord which ſaideſt vnto me, Returne vnto thy countrey, and to thy kindred, and I will doe thee good; I pray thee deliuer mee from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Eſau: for I feare him, leaſt he will come and ſmite me, and the mother vpon the children. For thou ſaideſt, I will ſurely doe thee good, and make thy ſeed as the ſand of the ſea, which cannot be numbred for multitude.</hi> So that when his brother <hi>Eſau</hi> came againſt him with foure hundred men, and he remembring his former inueterat mallice, feared that he would deſtroy them all, both young and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:7191:128"/> old, mother and children, he prayeth vnto God for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance: and that he might doe it with aſſurance of being heard, he looketh to Gods promiſes, who had ſaid, that he would doe him good.</p>
               <p>So muſt we doe in like maner, I meane when we come to prayer, we muſt throughly conſider of Gods moſt gracious and mercifull promiſes: which to that end are ſo infinit in number, for the good both of our ſoules and bodies, and for this life and the life to come, and for our ſelues and others, that I need not name any. Our ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt ſpeaketh thus vnto vs in the Goſpell,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>That whatſoeuer we aske the father in his name he will graunt it vnto vs.</hi> For (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith) <hi>All the promiſes of God in Chriſt are Yea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20.</note> 
                  <hi>and in him they are Amen, vnto the glory of God:</hi> that is, in him, and for his ſake ſhall moſt certainely be performed. Therefore for the verifying and fulfilling of them vnto vs, and for our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured hope of them in our prayers, we muſt not ſtay in the conſideration of our ſelues, to ſay, It is true in deed, that God hath promiſed to heare me; what cauſe is there in me that he ſhould doe ſo? for in our ſelues we ſhall find nothing but vnworthineſſe, and all cauſes to the contrary: but we muſt looke only to the merits and worthineſſe of Chriſt Ieſus, for whoſe ſake they were firſt made, and for whoſe ſake they ſhall be all of them fulfilled. And thus we may perceiue, that one cauſe for our doubting and little aſſurance of being heard, is the ignorance or not ſufficient meditating vpon the truth of Gods promiſes. Therefore when we come to prayer,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:7191:129"/> let vs thinke of them, that by them we might know that God will heare vs; for he that is faithfull hath ſo promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">We muſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate vpon thoſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſpecially, which doe concerne our preſent eſtate.</note>And as we muſt thus generally meditate vpon the promiſes of God: ſo becauſe he of his infinit goodneſſe hath made many promiſes vnto vs, according to euery need of ours; that we might be aſſured not onely gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally that God will heare vs, but particularly for that very thing that we ſtand in need of, and haue prayed for: we muſt ſpecially giue our ſelues to the meditation of ſuch promiſes, as doe moſt neerely conceiue that caſe of ours. And thus we haue alreadie ſeene how <hi>Iaakob</hi> did, when he was returning from <hi>Laban</hi> to his fathers houſe at the commaundement of God, and by the way was in great daunger (as he thought) of <hi>Eſau,</hi> he prayeth vnto God, and though the Lord had made many other promiſes vnto him, yet at this time he ſpecially thinketh of that, that God had ſayd vnto him concerning that matter:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.9.</note> and ſo beginneth his prayer thus, <hi>Lord which ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt vnto me, returne vnto thy countrey, and to thy kindred, and I will doe thee good; deliuer me out of the hand of my brother Eſau:</hi> and then he returneth vnto the promiſe of God againe, in theſe wordes: <hi>For thou ſaydest, I will doe thee good.</hi> And ſo muſt we doe for the obtaining of this aſſurance. As for example, if we pray for the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, and the aſſurance of the ſame, let vs ſeriouſly thinke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch promiſes, as God in his word hath made to that end:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21.</note> 
                  <hi>As at what time ſo euer a ſinner repenteth him of his ſinne from the bottome of his heart, I will put out all his wickedneſſe out of my remembrance, ſaith the Lord, by his Prophet:</hi> and againe what our ſauiour Chriſt ſaith in the Goſpell,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28.</note> 
                  <hi>Come vnto me all yee that are wearie, and laden, and I will eaſe you:</hi> where he calleth all without exception. So that if we find the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of our ſinnes intollerable vnto vs (as they are in themſelues) and we are weary of them, as of an heauie burden able to preſſe vs downe vnto the bottome of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:7191:129"/> hell, and there to hold vs for euer; and doe vnfainedly repent vs of them, and haue a full purpoſe to leaue them: then praying to God for the forgiueneſſe of them, we may know aſſuredly that God will heare vs: for here we haue his promiſe for it. And ſo muſt wee doe for any thing elſe that we need and pray for: as for this viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the plague,<note place="margin">As this ſtate of ours in this viſitation of the plague.</note> if we would pray for our brethren that are vnder it, in ſome good aſſurance, that God in his good time will of his vnſpeakeable mercy and louing kindneſſe remooue it, or mittigate it; let vs meditate vpon that, which God hath promiſed to ſuch kind of prayers: as when the Apoſtle S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>Is any ſicke among you, let him call for the Elders of the Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.14.</note> 
                  <hi>and let them pray for him; and the prayer of faith ſhall ſaue the ſicke, and the Lord ſhall raiſe him vp, and if he haue committed ſinne, it ſhall be forgiuen him:</hi> &amp; thefore he willeth them to acknowledge their ſinnes one to another, that they might be healed, <hi>for the prayer of a righteous man auaileth much, if it be feruent.</hi> VVhere we ſee, what is promiſed to ſome few of the Church, praying for them that are viſited with ſickneſſe, (and that iuſtly alſo for their ſinnes and for their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) that ſuch prayers ſhall not be in vaine, but moſt auaileable through Gods goodneſſe, for the pardoning of their ſinnes, and for the remoouing of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſame; if ſo be that they that pray be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and holy men, and pray feruently. Then from hence may we be aſſured in the like caſe, that if an whole Church and Congregation of Gods people, yea many Churches in diuers places, doe pray feruently for them; and they that are ſicke and vnder Gods hand will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their ſinnes vnto him, and repent them of them, and by this plague of God iudge themſelues for them; that he will put an happie end to it in time, though moſt righteouſly deſerued, and pardon their ſinnes, that haue beene the cauſe of it: that ſo wee might ſay before hand, <hi>Now I know, that God will heare vs:</hi> as indeed by his
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:7191:130"/> grace at this preſent, we doe and may ſee moſt cleerely, that by diminiſhing of it in the chiefe cities and places of this Realme where it is, and that alſo by leſſening of it in ſo great meaſure, <hi>He hath heard our prayers, and graunted our requeſts:</hi> That ſo hereafter by this bleſſed experience that we haue in one thing, we might be moued to come vnto him in great aſſurance, not doubting but that he will heare vs then alſo. And thus alwayes from time to time,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.16.</note> as the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>Come boldly into the throne of grace, that we may receiue mercy, and find grace to helpe in time of need:</hi> and therefore we muſt take this bleſsing vpon our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as a fruit of our daily prayer, and marke it well to that end.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Experience of former times increaſeth our aſſurance of being heard in prayer.</note>And this is that that ſhould be ſpoken of alſo, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that aſſurance that we ſhould haue in prayer, of being heard, That by dayly experience of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and mercifull dealing with vs, we ſhall dayly grow therein: and therefore that we might come vnto it, it is requiſit that wee ſhould greatly acquaint our ſelues with prayer, and pray often, and marke the ſequell, and what followeth after our prayers. For concerning this one point, it muſt needs be a very good reaſon, when we doe pray, to make vs know that God will heare vs; when we know already by experience, that he hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> often heard vs before. For ſeeing the ſame promiſes ſtill <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> remaine, and God is the ſame that made them, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them, and there is no change in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle (where he ſpeaketh of prayer, and to incourage vs to aske) ſaith, <hi>That he giueth liberally, and reprocheth no man:</hi> and after ſaith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iames</hi> 1.5.17.</note> 
                  <hi>that there is no variableneſse with him, nor ſhadow by turning:</hi> that is, though the ſunne by turning from the Eaſt to the VVeſt,<note place="margin">Reaſons of the ſame.</note> maketh great alterations, ſo that it is ſometime light, and ſometime darke; and beſides, the ſhadow is now here, and now there, and ſo is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes alike: yet it is not ſo with God, but he is alwayes like himſelfe. Therfore as he hath giuen in former times,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:7191:130"/> ſo will he do ſtill, if we pray to him as we haue done: for he is no niggard, but giueth liberally to all that aske, &amp; reprocheth no man with that that he hath giuen: nei- is he any changeling, but conſtant in all his wayes. And beſides <hi>Ieſus Christ</hi> the mediatour of the promiſes, <hi>Hee is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the ſame to day, that he was yeſterday, and will be euer:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.8. <hi>and</hi> 7.24.</note> and he at the right hand of God maketh requeſt for vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and is not wearie of his office, neither is his loue diminiſhed one whit towards vs. Therefore we may wel build our hope for the time to come, vpon our former experience, as vpon a ſure rocke that ſhall not bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued. And ſo we may pray as <hi>Dauid</hi> did,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119 149.</note> 
                  <hi>O Lord quicken me according to thy cuſtome:</hi> as if he had ſayd, Thou haſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heretofore quickened and reuiued me by thy word and by thy ſpirit, therefore doe ſo now alſo in this great ſorrow and deadneſſe of mind; for I ſtand in as much need of it as euer I did, and thou art as well able to doe it, as thou haſt beene. Thus from the cuſtome of Gods former dealing, he hopeth that he will doe ſo now. And indeed there is great reaſon of it: for if we haue had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> recourſe to any man for help in the time of our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp; we haue ſeene how he hath bin moſt willing to do it from time to time; we will not doubt of him, but that he will doe ſo ſtill, and that we ſhall find him a faithfull friend vnto vs, as hetherto he hath bin &amp; the oftner that we haue made triall of him, and haue found, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer deceiued vs, the bolder we are to come vnto him, and do aſſure our ſelues of help from him aboue all other in the world; ſo that if all ſhould faile, we would make account of him. And we ſee that the beggers that goe vp and downe from doore to doore, will be moſt bold of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe there where they haue had often almes: and if they ſhould find it otherwiſe at any time, they would greatly maruaile at it, and thinke that there were ſome ſtrange alteration in them; and they would ſay to them, You had wont to be a good maſter and miſtris vnto me,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:7191:131"/> and to do ſo and ſo for me, and that made me the bolder to come vnto you now: thus would they plead for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. So we then much more vpon former experience of our prayers heard, and of the reliefe that wee haue found at Gods hand (ſeeing there is no change in him, nor in his promiſes) muſt learne to know, that if there be no change in vs, but we be the ſame that we haue been, and ſeeke to him and ſerue him as we haue done, he will heare vs, and helpe vs, as he hath done before.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">That we might haue this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, we muſt vſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</note>To this end it is requiſit, that we pray often; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ariſeth not of one action, nor of ſome few, but of many; and the beſt experience is gotten by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of many things in a long time: and therefore they that liue long and practiſe much, haue the greateſt and beſt experience. So that if we will haue experience of Gods goodneſſe in hearing our prayers, that thereby we might know that he will heare vs ſtill, we muſt pray often, and be well acquainted with this holy ordinance of prayer. For as among men, it is not the comming once or twice to a man, and that a long time one after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, yea though he ſpeedeth, that can giue him any great encouragement to preſume of his helpe in the time of great need; but that hee hath beene long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, and made often triall of him. So is it with God, it is not the praying now and then to him, that can by experience giue vs any great aſſurance, that he will heare vs, and helpe vs in time of our trouble; but that we haue vſed it often, and vſed it a long time, and haue found, that we haue neuer beene ſent away emptie. For the Lord ſometimes heareth the wicked, and now and then giueth them ſomething that they aske; but as they pray ſeldome, ſo oftentimes they aske and receiue not,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Iſai</hi> 1.15.</note> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>yea they crie, and the Lord heareth them not:</hi> but as they haue ſtopped their ears at the word of God, ſo he ſtoppeth his eares at their prayers: ſo they can haue no aſſurance by experience,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:7191:131"/> though God haue giuen them ſomething:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mich.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.13.</note> for a man may once or twice do for his enemie, and for him whom he neuer meaneth to gratifie any more. Another cauſe then, why wee haue ſo little knowledge in the time of our need, that God will heare vs, is, that we haue ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle acquainted our ſelues with prayer, and that we haue not done as the Apoſtle willeth vs, namely,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6.</note> 
                  <hi>in all things made our requests knowne vnto God in ſupplication and prayer:</hi> that is, we haue not ſo often prayed vnto him, as wee haue need, and ſo we haue not that experience that we might haue had. Seeing then that this is a great bleſsing of God, which is or ſhould be deſired of all, namely, to know when we pray, that God will heare vs; let vs come often vnto him in prayer: and that I may vſe the words of S. <hi>Paule,</hi> In all places and vpon all occaſions lift vp pure hands vnto God, that we may haue often talk with God, and be (as it were) well acquainted with him, and ſo by experience know, what account we may make of his helpe.</p>
               <p>And that our experience herein might be ſuch as it ought, we muſt not onely pray often, as hath beene ſaid before: but eſpecially we muſt well ſee, and diligently marke how God graunteth our requeſts, and alwayes conſider, what hath followed vpon our prayers.<note place="margin">And then wee muſt marke what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon our prayers.</note> And this is that that <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayth of himſelfe:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Heare my voice in the morning, O Lord, for earely in the morning I will direct my prayer vnto thee, and I will wait:</hi> where he ſaith, That when he had prayed vnto God, he would tarrie Gods leiſure, and conſider what followed vpon his prayers. For all good experience ariſeth not ſo much of the often practiſe of a thing, as of the wiſe and diligent obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the euent of it: inſomuch that ſome ſhall vſe a thing very often, and yet make little or no vſe of it at all to themſelues: as we ſee ſome neuer marke what meat or drinke doth hurt them. But the skilfull phyſition, that hath often preſcribed a medicine againſt ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:7191:132"/> and hath marked in his patient, how it hath wrought, and how he hath been cured by it, thereby ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth a certaine knowledge, that this medicine is good for the cure of ſuch a diſeaſe: for (ſaith he) I haue not only often giuen it, but haue found, that many haue been cured by it: and thus all rules of that art, as of all other, ariſe of experience, that is, of marking what was the effect of ſuch a cauſe. So then, when a man hath not onely often prayed vnto God, but hath alſo marked, how he hath obtained his requeſts at the hand of God: then, ſpecially from the promiſes of God, and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from his owne experience of the truth of them, hee gathereth a certaine knowledge, <hi>that God will heare him:</hi> for he conſidereth how according to that goodneſſe that is in him, and the truth of his promiſes, he hath often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times heard him before. Otherwiſe it may come to paſſe, that though the Lord hath often heard vs,<note place="margin">For want of this we haue not that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from experience, that we might.</note> and that in many things, if we either through negligence haue not regarded it, or through careleſneſſe haue forgotten it, we can haue little knowledge in the time of our need, that he will heare vs. And thus the Lord many times in iuſtice puniſheth the vnthankefulneſſe of men, who marke not his fatherly dealing towards themſelues, for their owne comfort, and the praiſe of his name: that though he hath often holpen them, and all the world hath ſeene it, yet in their greateſt need they are in as much doubt of his goodneſſe, and pray with as great diſtruſt, as though he had neuer done any thing for them before. As on the other ſide he thus in mercy and fauour plentifully rewardeth the thankfulneſſe of thoſe that often pray and call vpon him in the time of their trouble, and alſo carefully marke, and diligently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, what hee hath done for them, to prayſe his holy name for the ſame, that by this good experience they know, what, he will doe for them for the time to come.</p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:7191:132"/>
               <p>And thus it falleth out, when we haue any dealing with men:<note place="margin">Thus is it, when we haue any dealing with men.</note> as when in any diſtreſſe we ſhallbe in ſuch caſe, that we know not whom to ſeeke to for helpe; and we complaining of it, one ſhould ſay to vs, Goe to ſuch a man; and then we ſhould ſay, nay, for I know not what he will doe for me, he neuer did any thing for me yet, and therefore I haue no great cauſe to preſume of his helpe. Then the other ſhall ſay to vs againe, yea, that is not ſo: for I remember my ſelfe how at ſuch a time, in ſuch a need, you had great ſuccour and comfort from him: then we being not able to denie it, ſhould ſay, It is true indeed, as you ſay, but my memorie is ſo ill, that I had cleane forgotten it. Are we not here iuſtly puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for our vnthankefulneſſe, to doubt of a mans good will there, where there was no cauſe? So is it when by forgetting Gods mercifull dealing towards vs, we doubt of his goodneſſe in the greateſt time of our need, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any iuſt cauſe. But otherwiſe he that well beareth in mind what benefits from time to time hee receiueth of men, to be thankefull vnto them for the ſame; he can in any diſtreſſe preſently tell what to doe, and ſay, to his owne comfort, as namely, I will goe to ſuch a man, for I remember how often he hath done for me heretofore. So fareth it with all them, that marke what God hath done for them. In this reſpect therefore it is requiſit, that we keepe a regiſter of all Gods benefits,<note place="margin">We muſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore keepe a regiſter of Gods benefits. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.1.</note> and ſay to our ſelues as <hi>Dauid</hi> doth, <hi>Praiſe the Lord O my ſoule, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not all his benefits.</hi> Eſpecially we muſt marke diligently, what things he hath done at our prayers: the ſame <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> alſo ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>This poore man cried,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.6.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Lord heard him, and ſaued him out of all troubles.</hi> And as hee in ſome caſes did make ſpeciall Pſalmes, which beare the titile of remembrance, and they were made ſpecially that by them he might keepe a thankefull memorie of Gods benefits:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.</note> ſo ought we to doe ſome thing to helpe our memorie this way, eſpecially when we ſee how for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:7191:133"/> we are of them: that ſo vpon long experience we might ſay, <hi>I know that God will heare and helpe me.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we haue prayed for any common benefit, or for any deliuerance, as feare of enemies, and ſuch like, when we haue prayed in the Church here for any that haue beene ſicke, when for others in other caſes priuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when for our ſelues at home or any of ours; if we had from time to time marked and remembred in all theſe, how God hath anſwered vs gratiouſly, we might now, when we meet to pray for the remouing of this viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, haue had greater hope of being heard than we haue, and greater aſſurance of Gods goodneſſe towards vs. But ſeeing we haue beene ſo vnprofitable in times paſt, to our owne hinderance, let vs make the beſt vſe of the time preſent, that we can.

And thus much out of theſe wordes both for the aſſurance of faith in which we ſhould pray, and for the meanes whereby we may attaine vnto it.</p>

Therefore as hee was directed to make this prayer by the ſpirit of God, ſo when he came to this part of it, it did ſpecially ſhew forth it ſelfe in the aſſurance of faith, which hee had thereby, and ſo cauſed him to breake out into theſe wordes, <hi>Now know I:</hi> becauſe that by continuance in prayer he attained vnto a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of faith and aſſurance than he had at the firſt. And this great affection of the mind in prayer, he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to commend vnto them, to that end, that they might both labour for it, and looke to come vnto it euery one in their meaſure; namely, that the longer and the more earneſtly they prayed for him, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſurance they ſhould haue by the ſpirit of God, that the Lord did and would heare them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though they did know at the firſt, that God would heare them according to his will, as hee had promiſed, which promiſes they were not ignorant of: yet by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in prayer, or after their prayer, they might looke to be further aſſured of it from God by his holy ſpirit, that was in them.</p>
               <p>For the Lord God vſeth thus to worke by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in thoſe that be his, that when their hearts are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared aright to ſerue him,<note place="margin">As in all the parts of Gods ſeruice, the longer wee continue in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the more doth his ſpirit by them work in vs.</note> the longer that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue vnder the meanes of their ſaluation, the more effectuall is the operation of his holy ſpirit in them thereby. As for example, in the hearing of the word of God, they are more affected in the middeſt than they were at the beginning, and many times moſt of all in the ending; if they be diligent and attentiue hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and not drowſie and careleſſe, and labour to ſtirre
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:7191:134"/> vp the ſpirit of God in themſelues. So is it in praying alſo, when they come to it with due preparation of the heart, the children of God doe often find, that though they had ſome good meaſure of faith in Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and feeling of his loue in the beginning, yet by continuance in prayer, the ſame was greatly enlarged and encreaſed in them: ſo that it was more at the middeſt, than at the firſt; in ſo much, that then they could ſay with greater freedome of the ſpirit, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of faith, Now know I indeed, that the Lord will helpe me, and doth heare me from heauen: and in the end they haue had more aſſurance: and ſometimes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they haue done praying, moſt of all. Thus their faith, knowledge, and aſſurance, that the Lord did hear them, it hath growne by degrees, and encreaſed till it came to the full, when they haue prayed feruently. And hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it commeth to paſſe, that we find in the Pſalmes, that very often they breake out into ſome ſudden paſsion of ioy, or glorying in the Lord, and as it were boaſting of the goodneſſe of God towards them: as though they had then euen alreadie obtained their deſire: becauſe they felt and found that the Lord did giue them ſome good aſſurance of it. As wee ſee how (beſides that which they profeſſe here) in the end of the Pſalme, they vtter theſe words of great confidence, as though the victorie were alreadie gotten, which if it had been, it had beene in vaine to pray for defence againſt enemies: they ſpeake, I ſay, thus confidently, <hi>They are brought downe and fallen, but wee are riſen, and stand vpright.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is that which wee may obſerue, and moſt clearely ſee, firſt of all in the third Pſalme: where hee beginneth his prayer very vncomfortably,<note place="margin">Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> beginning his prayer ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; endeth with great aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.1.</note> and greatly complaineth of the multitude of his aduerſaries, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliouſly were riſen vp againſt him, ſaying, <hi>Lord how are mine aduerſaries increaſed? How many riſe against mee. Many
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:7191:135"/> ſay to my ſoule, there is no helpe for him in God.</hi> Afterwards he confirmeth his faith in the goodneſſe of God by the conſideration of his nature, that he is a defence &amp; buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to them that are vnarmed and without defence: and he giueth glory to them that haue ignominie caſt vpon them without a cauſe, and he rayſeth vp them that are falling,<note place="margin">Verſe 3.</note> ſaying, <hi>But thou Lord art a buckler for me, my glory, and the lifter vp of my head,</hi> And then he gathereth more ſtrength of faith from former experience,<note place="margin">Verſe 4.</note> ſaying, <hi>I did call vnto the Lord with my voyce, and he heard me out of the holy mountaine:</hi> and to this he addeth, <hi>Shelah,</hi> to ſhew how greatly it did affect him, and what comfort he had in this to remember, that God had heard his prayer in former times: and then further addeth for the ſtrengthening of his faith, that the Lord in other great danger had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him,<note place="margin">Verſe 5.</note> ſaying, <hi>I laid me downe and ſlept, and roſe vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: for the Lord ſustained me.</hi> And thereupon inferreth this confident ſpeech,<note place="margin">Verſe 6.</note> full of aſſurance: <hi>I will not be afraid for ten thouſand of the people that ſhould beſet me round about.</hi> VVhere he doth glory by faith, that though his enemies were neuer ſo many, and himſelfe in neuer ſo great danger of them, hee would not bee too much afraid of them, but was aſſured that the Lord would defend him in the middeſt of them. And this aſſurance of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence hee obtaineth now at the laſt, by continuing in prayer, and by thoſe meditations which he had in prayer of the goodneſſe and mercie of God towards all his, and now ſpecially towards himſelfe: which he hath ſet down in the former verſes, and part of his prayer. So falleth it out with others, that the ſpirit of God in them, which is the ſpirit of prayer and of all aſſurance, as it ſtirreth them vp to pray; and when they cannot tell of themſelues what or how to pray, as they ought, the ſame ſpirit hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth their infirmities,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.</note> and ſtirreth vp in them ſighes and grones, and deſires of the hart, which are acceptable, and which God alloweth of, becauſe they are according to his
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:7191:135"/> will: ſo the ſame alſo helpeth their infirmities in this point, that whereas they began to pray in great weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and much doubting becauſe of their temptations; by calling into their minds more freſhly than before, the promiſes of God made in his word, and the often perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the ſame to others &amp; to themſelues; it cauſeth them to grow in faith, &amp; doth giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome greater aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Gods fauours, and of being gratiouſly heard, than they had in the beginning, &amp; they know then more fully that he doth heare them, and will helpe them.<note place="margin">And ſo the ſpirit of God in prayer hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the reſt of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.1.</note> And though this may ſeeme ſtrange to ſuch as are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with prayer, who vſe it very ſeldome or not at all, and make it but a matter of forme and cuſtome: yet I doubt not, but that we haue a great cloud of faithfull witneſſes, who vſing prayer often of conſcience, and in the feeling of their wantes, and making it a dayly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and therein deale with the Lord in good earneſt, as thoſe that would obtaine ſome thing at his hand, and reſt not in the bare action of prayer, as in a worke wrought, or a certaine taske performed and done; who doe and are able to ſubſcribe moſt willingly vnto the truth of this by their owne practiſe. So that as <hi>Dauid</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this prayer, when his ſonne <hi>Abſolom</hi> with <hi>Achitophell</hi> and many others rayſed vp a rebellon againſt him, in which for the ſafegard of his life he was compelled to flie out of Ieruſalem (as appeareth by the title of the Pſalme) did by continuance in feruent prayer, obtaine this aſſurance, That the Lord would defend him, and confound them all, and therefore he would not be afraid of them, if there were ten thouſand of them, and they all ſhould beſet him round about; that is, if he were brought into great ſtraits (as indeed he was:) and truely it came to paſſe in the end, for <hi>Achitophell</hi> did hang him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and <hi>Abſalom</hi> was hanged by the haire of the head. As, I ſay, <hi>Dauid</hi> then had aſſurance of this before hand: ſo alſo others of Gods ſeruants in their daungers and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:7191:136"/> troubles praying to God feruently, (as he did) haue in ſome good meaſure to their owne comfort, and the comfort of others that haue prayed with them, obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of God by his ſpirit an aſſurance, that the Lord did heare them, and would be mercifull vnto them, and they by faith haue profeſſed the ſame to others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand.</p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> againe by continuing in feruent prayer, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of being heard.</note>And this growing and increaſing in the aſſured hope, That the Lord will heare vs (whereof we now ſpeak) <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> againe ſetteth downe by his owne experience in the ſixt Pſalme, (as indeed I muſt needs confeſſe, that he was a man of wonderfull great experience both of his owne infirmitie, and of Gods mercifull dealing towards him:) which Pſalme was made when he was grieuouſly ſicke and like to die, and did not onely feele the hand of God heauie vpon himſelfe this way (as appeareth by his grieuous complaints and outcries) but he was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in his mind for his ſinne: and in this eſtate he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto God, To remoue from him this great token of his wrath and diſpleaſure, that was vpon him, and to take away this grieuous ſcourge that he was then affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with, and to giue him both health of bodie and quietneſſe of mind: of both which at the laſt hee obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſo great aſſurance by faith, through the inward working of Gods ſpirit, that he doth openly glory of it againſt all his enemies, that reioyced at his fall. And for the vnderſtanding of this it is requiſit (eſpecially for the ſimpler ſort, to whoſe capacitie I haue eſpecially framed my ſelfe) requiſit, I ſay, to ſet down in order the words of the whole Pſalme; for otherwiſe, neither the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and reioycing of his faith, which in the end with much ſtriuing he attained vnto; nor the feruencie of his prayer, which was a meanes whereby Gods ſpirit wrought it in him, can be ſo fully perceiued, or made plaine vnto you. Thus therfore he beginneth his prayer, <hi>O Lord,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>for the Lord hath heard the voyce of my weeping.

And not onely that is to be marked, but eſpecially this, that he commeth vnto this aſſurance, not vntill the end of many long and feruent prayers: and that in the beginning either he had it not at al, or nothing in that meaſure, that there he profeſſeth it: for then no doubt he would haue done it ſooner, and not ſo long haue fed himſelfe with ſuch grieuous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and lamentable outcries, as there hee doth.<note place="margin">And ſo may we do: for God giueth it by ordinarie meanes.</note>
               </p>
               <p>So is it poſsible for vs, in what trouble ſoeuer we ſhall be in, if we pray vnto God in all humilitie and ſorrow
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:7191:137"/> for our ſinnes, as he did, euen with great aboundance of teares (for he ſaith, That he watered his couch, and made his bed to ſwim with them: by which hyperbolicall kind of ſpeech he meaneth, That he wept very much, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the day, but euen in the night alſo) and if we did pray with that feruencie that he did, not fainting nor giuing ouer, but ſtretching out our affections and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, according to our preſent need; it is poſsible, I ſay, for vs to attaine by degrees vnto that meaſure of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of Gods goodneſſe towards vs, that may ſuffice vs. And though wee come not to that great meaſure that was in this holy man, becauſe we pray not in that feruencie and zeale, and tenderneſſe of heart that hee did, yet in ſome acceptable meaſure, and more than we had in the beginning. For I am not of that opinion, that this was inſpired into him as he was a Prophet, who had many things extraordinarie; neither that any man can come to haue any aſſurance or full perſuaſion either of their ſaluation, or that God heareth their prayers, or of any other fauour from him, without ſome reuelation, and ſo it ſhould be thought preſumption in a man to ſay he is aſſured of ſuch things: but that God giueth this aſſurance, and increaſeth it by ordinarie meanes; and namely and eſpecially by prayer. For ſeeing prayer is very fitly compared vnto wraſtling or ſtriuing (as we haue ſeene heretofore) by which we labour with all the power of our ſoules and bodies,<note place="margin">A compariſon to ſhew the truth of it.</note> to obtaine ſome thing of the Lord: as by bodily ſtriuing men ſeeke to obtaine ſome maſterie among men: (and thus the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of it to the Romanes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.30.</note> Deſiring them to ſtriue with him by prayers to God for him:) as in ſtriuing, a mans ſtrength is not alwayes greateſt at the firſt, neither can himſelfe or others perceiue ſo well, whether he ſhall ouercome; but ſometimes, yea moſt vſually, when after ſome paines taken his bodie is well heat, he increaſeth in ſtrength of bodie and agilitie of lims: whereby it
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:7191:137"/> commeth to paſſe, that he findeth that in himſelfe, which giueth him greater hope of preuailing againſt his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, than he had before: So is it when we pray to God, and as it were ſtriue with him; that though wee put all our ſtrength vnto it at the firſt, that is, pray with all the deſire of our hearts; yet when by continuance in praier, the ſpirit of God in vs is well heat, as I may ſay, and the heat of it increaſed, we ſhall find that both our deſires are greatly increaſed, &amp; alſo our aſſurance from thence of being heard, is inlarged. So that in the middeſt or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of our prayers we ſhall perceiue our minds more pacified and quiet, and our ſelues more readie to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our wils to the will of God, and to reſt in the hope of his defence and deliuerance, than before. VVhereof (if we were asked) though we could giue no great reaſon from outward things; for all things are ſtill with vs, as they were before: yet we find it to be true by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and muſt account it a fruit of our prayer, in that the Lord hath giuen vs greater aſſurance than wee had before, and ſo we are contented to wait vpon him.</p>
               <p>The like may bee ſhewed in many other Pſalmes,<note place="margin">Another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of this, in the perſon of <hi>Dauid.</hi>

VVhich full perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion if he had had before in that meaſure that he had then, we may be aſſured, that he would ſooner haue profeſſed it, to the glory of God, and his owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>

                  </note>I will conclude this point, with that which is in the eight and thirtie Pſalme: which Pſalme was made, when he was in ſome great diſtreſſe of ſickeneſſe (as ſome think) or ſome other at the leaſt. And the whole Pſalme is full of grieuous complaints as may appeare to them that will but read it, when he beginneth thus: <hi>O Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke me not in thine anger,</hi>

He firſt complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of the heauie wrath of God that was vpon him, and of his ſinnes, which he acknowledgeth to be the cauſe of his puniſhment: of the infirmitie and great weakeneſſe, that he found in himſelfe, both of ſoule and bodie: and of this alſo, that he was forſaken of his friends,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:7191:138"/> and left deſolat: &amp; of the mallice of his wicked enemies, all which made him (as hee ſaith) <hi>to poure out his whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire before the Lord,</hi> ſo that his ſighing was not hid from him.<note place="margin">Verſ. 9.</note> And then at the laſt he commeth to haue ſome good aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that the Lord would heare him, and doth open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſe it in theſe words: <hi>On thee O Lord doe I wait,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>thou wilt heare me O Lord my God:</hi> and ſo from this aſſurance, hee endeth the Pſalme ſomewhat more comfortably than he began it, ſaying, <hi>Hast thee to helpe me, O my Lord,</hi>

                  <hi>my ſaluation.</hi> Thus we ſee, how by continuing in feruent prayer, and ſtriuing againſt all things within him and without him, that might diſcourage him, the ſpirit of God did ſo encreaſe in him, that hee gat ſome ſmall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance at the leaſt, and more than he had before, that the Lord would heare him: and ſo endeth with a more peaceable and quiet mind than he began. And though I am not ignorant, that ſome of the learned doe read that fifteenth verſe ſomewhat otherwiſe; yet they agree with me in this point, for which it is brought, That in the ſame he profeſſeth his faith, that the Lord would heare him.</p>
               <p>All theſe examples doe not onely ſhew vs the truth of this doctrine, namely, that the ſeruants of God pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto him in their ſeuerall troubles (as this people did here) haue by little and little growne in a further aſſurance to their owne comfort and the glorie of God,<note place="margin">By this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we ſee what aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce God may worke in vs, if we vſe the ſame meanes.</note> that he will heare them: but they ſhew vs the ſame by great experience, which is the beſt tracts, and able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the moſt ſimple: for wee haue heard how <hi>Dauid</hi> oftentimes profeſſeth it of himſelfe; which ſheweth vs what we may looke for that the Lord ſhould worke in vs alſo (for there is no reſpect of perſons with him) if we pray in that feeling of our wants, and that humilitie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the croſſe, and that feruencie vnder hope, and that continuance by patience, that he did. Therefore let vs labour after it, euen that we may find the ſpirit of God
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:7191:139"/> ſo working in our hearts by prayer, that it may certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and comfortably witneſſe to our ſpirits, that the Lord doth heare vs; and that the ſame teſtimonie of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may encreaſe in vs, aswe encreaſe in praying. And it may come to paſſe, that as in the morning we ſee the Sunne ariſe higher and higher, whereby we haue a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter feeling of the heat of it, as the day encreaſeth: ſo we might ſee the ſonne of righteouſneſſe ſo ariſing in our hearts,<note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">And a reaſon of the ſame.</note> To ſatisfie all thoſe, and to ſtrengthen them in this weakneſſe of theirs, we muſt conſider, That they that haue had the greateſt aſſurance at any time, that the Lord did heare them, haue had it but in time, and in meaſure, and not alwaies alike; but ſometimes more, ſometimes leſſe, and ſometimes not at all: as the ſpirit of faith, or their owne vnbeleefe hath preuailed in them. For in theſe forenamed places we ſee, that in ſome of the Pſalmes hee profeſſeth greater aſſurance, than in other: and ſo is it with all men. Euen as with the eyes of our bodie we ſometimes ſee a thing more
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:7191:139"/> clearely than at other times, and our eyeſight is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes alike: no more is our faith whereby wee behold Chriſt, and in him the fauour of God, it is not alwaies in the ſame brightneſſe. Beſides, as the ayre is not alwaies alike for our ſight, but ſometimes more troubleſome and ſouring, yea darke, which hindereth vs from the ſight of that that we looke vnto, when our eyes are at the beſt: ſo we haue ſometimes in our mind greater and more violent temptations, than at other, as it were thick myſtes or rather darke clouds in the aire to hinder our faith from beholding the cheerefull countenance of the Lord, as it were the light of the Sunne: which ſhineth alwayes alike, though we by reaſon of theſe cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſee it alike. So the Lords loue is alwaies one and the ſame, but we are not alwaies alike diſpoſed in our ſelues to behold it in that brightneſſe, that it ſhineth in it owne nature. Therefore we muſt not be diſmaied, if we haue not alwaies this aſſurance in our prayer after the ſame manner: but ſee what is the cauſe of it, and ſtriue againſt that, that ſo wee may come vnto it in time, and in that meaſure that the Lord ſhall beſtow it vpon vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we muſt conſider,<note place="margin">Another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it.</note> that this people doth pray very feruently and often for this, That God would heare and helpe their king; before they come to this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, as appeareth by all the former wordes: when they ſay, <hi>The Lord heare thee, the name of God defend thee, ſend thee helpe, and strengthen thee, let him remember thine offerings, and turne thy burnt offerings into aſhes, graunt thee according to thine heart, fulfill all thy purpoſe, &amp;c.</hi> VVhere there are many ſhort and earneſt petitions for the ſame thing: which doubling of their words and of their requeſts in ſo great ſhortneſſe, doe ſufficiently ſhew, how feruently they prayed. For wee muſt not thinke, that they vſe vaine babbling, heaping vp a multitude of words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſence, feeling, or deſire of the thing anſwerable
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:7191:140"/> vnto the ſame, as it is the manner of hypocrits and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to doe, who vſe repetitions, and thinke to be heard for their much babling:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.7.</note> againſt whom our Sauiour Chriſt ſpeaketh in the Goſpell. But this prayer being firſt made by <hi>Dauid,</hi> who had the ſpirit of God; and for the Church, which is ruled by the ſame ſpirit; we may by their words very cleerely diſcerne &amp; ſee their ſpirit that they prayed with, namely, with great earneſtneſſe and feeling: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when this word <hi>Selah,</hi> which noteth ſome great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the mind, is added: and thus doing, they come to a greater aſſurance at the laſt, I meane by this continuance in feruent prayer. So in all the other Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> which we alledged before, wee ſee that he prayeth not coldly, or in a word: but very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, often, and long before he profeſſeth this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Therefore if we will come vnto it in our meaſure, we muſt labour to haue the feeling of our want, and to be troubled for it, and ſo pray earneſtly: we muſt come alſo in the faith of Gods goodneſſe, and hope of being heard, by conſidering the promiſes of his word, and the fulfilling of the ſame: we muſt continue in prayer, and pray often for the ſame thing; ſo ſhall it come to paſſe, that we ſhall not onely beleeue beforehand generally, that God will heare vs; but more particularly in that very thing that we pray for, find ſome aſſurance encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in vs, that he will helpe vs; and we muſt wait vpon him alſo to haue a greater aſſurance of it wrought in vs afterwards. Therefore let vs doe thus, and ſee whether the Lord in many things that we pray for, will not giue vs that aſſurance, that he will helpe vs ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; either by mitigating the thing that is vpon vs, or deliuering vs cleane from it, or giuing vs patience vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, or encreaſing our ſtrength to beare it, or turning it vnto our good: ſo that wee ſhall ſee, the more wee pray, the more quiet ſhall we be in ſubmitting our wils to the will of God, and aſſuring our ſelues, that ſome
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:7191:140"/> way or other the Lord will heare vs, and helpe vs.</p>
               <p>And furthermore concerning this particular, that they pray for, euen for <hi>Dauid</hi> their king, they had this aſſurance that God would heare him,<note place="margin">How we may be aſſured that God will hear vs for others.</note> and helpe him. And ſo I doubt not but that many faithfull ſubiects and people in this land hauing in like maner prayed for their kings, and queenes, and gouernours, God hath giuen them aſſurance, that he hath heard them for them: and the more that any haue done ſo, the greater aſſurance haue they had. As many praying for the life of our late Queene <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> God did not onely preſerue her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from a number of treaſons intended againſt her, but they had by their prayers comfort ouer it for the time to come, that the Lord would do ſo ſtill. And ſo ſhal we now haue for his moſt excellent maieſtie that now is, though he be ſubiect to many perils, as appeareth by the terrible murthers and treaſons that haue already broken out againſt his royall perſon, and whole proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: that if we vſe to pray often for him publikely and priuatly, and that feruently with all our deſires, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that he is the Lords anoynted (that is) that he is ſet ouer vs by the Lord in his iuſt title and inheritance;<note place="margin">As for the king.</note> that the Lord, who is the defender of all right, will not onely preſerue him ſtill, maugre their heads, as hitherto he hath done, but will aſſure vs of it in ſome good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; that wee ſhall quietly ſubmit our ſelues to his peaceable and gratious gouernment, and not greatly feare the malitious attempts of his and our enemies. But as hee is religious himſelfe, and vſeth to pray for himſelfe, and putteth his truſt in God; ſo we praying often alſo and earneſtly for him, ſhall know more and more, that the Lord will heare him, and vs for him. And this is true not onely of our gouernours, but of all men: ſo that if we vſe to pray often for others, and if they haue made knowne and commended their eſtate vnto vs to that end; and we thereupon be feruent with the Lord
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:7191:141"/> for them;<note place="margin">And for them that are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the plague.</note> it will come to paſſe, that not onely the Lord will heare vs for them, but we ſhall haue good hope of it, and ſo we ſhall haue comfort beforehand, that God will doe good vnto them: and the oftner that we pray for any in any diſtreſſe of theirs, the more aſſurance ſhall we haue, God in his good time will heare vs for them. And I doubt not but that in this time of ſickneſſe and mortalitie many haue found this to be true by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that by continuall and feruent prayer they haue not onely obtained this aſſurance for themſelues, that the Lord will helpe them, but for others. Let that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience mooue vs for the time to come, to pray ſtill for thoſe that are in this viſitation, or in the feare of it, that we may know at the laſt, that the Lord will heare vs for them alſo, and helpe them in his bleſſed time, by the mightie power of his right hand: which we beſeech him, that we may find at his mercifull hand, for Ieſus Chriſts ſake our mediatour and redeemer.

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:7191:141"/> profeſſeth that he had this aſſurance in himſelfe, ſo he commending it vnto them to vſe, doubted not, but that all of them praying together, ſome of them at the leaſt ſhould haue it alſo, and ſo might ſay in their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>I know that God will helpe his anointed:</hi> and ſo ſhould pray in that faith, whereby he might verely beleeue, that God would heare him, and ſo he might obtaine helpe and aſſurance of it for all the reſt: and by that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that God ſhould giue him, he might comfort the reſt. In ſo much that though euery man and woman then preſent, through the weakeneſſe of their faith could not come vnto this aſſurance, (which yet they ſhould labour after, as hath beene ſaid before? yet ſome one or other among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, more or fewer, might haue it in great meaſure: and ſo the Lord might aſſure them of it for the reſt, that God would heare them. And ſo this ſhould be the benefit of the common prayer of the Church, when many were met together, and that to euery one that ioyned with them, That though all of them could not come to that meaſure of aſſurance in their prayers that they deſired, that the Lord would heare them;<note place="margin">When many pray together, one may haue aſſurance for all the reſt, that God doth heare them.</note> yet ſome one or other ſhould haue it for them, and ſo when it was a common benefit that they prayed for, they ſhould not onely obtaine it together, (for the Lord would heare them) but ſome ſhould more ſpecially know it beforehand, to their owne comfort, and the comfort of others. And this no doubt is a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar great comfort in any trouble, that when many are together and in great heauineſſe, by reaſon of ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie or feare that is vpon them: and none among them is able to comfort themſelues, much leſſe are they able to comfort others, that are feeble minded among them, though they deſire to doe it; and though they ſeeke to God for comfort, and pray for it moſt earneſtly, yet they cannot find it in themſelues: at the laſt God ſhall ſo ſtirre vp the ſpirit of ſome one or other among
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:7191:142"/> them, and ſhall ſo aſſure him, that God will be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto them, that he ſhall conſtantly and openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it vnto them to their comfort alſo; comfort I ſay, though not in themſelues, yet from him. For though he, euen but one, hath it properly in himſelfe, yet he hath it not for himſelfe alone, but for others that are with him, and in the ſame danger and feare, who need to be comforted: and they ſhall fare the better by it.

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, from hence we may ſee generally, what a bleſſed thing it is alwaies to keepe companie with the godly, and thoſe that walke in his wayes: for if any trouble doe befall them, they may pray together, and God may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure one or other for the reſt, that he is among them, and will be good vnto them. And thus was it with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paule</hi> and all his companie, when they were in that long &amp; dangerous nauigation towards Rome, in which all of them were in feare of their liues, as it is ſet downe at large in the Acts of the Apoſtles:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 27.20.</note> when they were ſo toſſed by the wind and by the ſea, that they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to caſt all things out of the ſhip, to eaſe her of her burden; and the weather was ſo foule, that by the ſpace of many daies they ſaw neither Sunne nor ſtars to guide them or comfort them: ſo that all hope that they ſhould be ſaued, was taken from them: and their feare was ſo
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:7191:143"/> great and ſo continuall, that for fourteene daies toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they faſted, and could not take their ordinary food: and there were in the ſhip at that time two hundred threeſcore and ſeuenteene ſoules, among whom was <hi>Paule</hi> a priſoner, and ſome other Chriſtians with him. At which time we may be aſſured, that he and the reſt that feared God, prayed earneſtly vnto him, that they might be ſaued: and God did not onely heare them, but gaue vnto <hi>Paule</hi> aſſurance thereof by a viſion of an Angell that appeared vnto him in the night, and ſaid vnto him, That for his ſake all ſhould be ſaued, onely the ſhip ſhould be loſt; and this as hee did beleeue, ſo hee moſt confidently auoucheth it vnto them: and exhorteth them earneſtly to eat their meat,<note place="margin">Verſe 36.</note> and to be comforted, and doubt not but the Lord would ſaue them all. Then it is ſaid, that all of them began to pull vp their hearts, and to be of good courage, and alſo to take their meat. So that here we ſee, how in a common calamitie that was vpon a multitude, God gaue aſſurance of deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance but vnto one, who could ſay, as he did, <hi>I know that God will helpe:</hi> but all the reſt had the benefit of it; for thereby, their hearts that ſo failed before that they could not eat their meat, now began to bee of good courage.<note place="margin">Moſes at the red ſea by prayer was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured for all the reſt, that God would helpe them.</note>
               </p>
               <p>So was it with the children of Iſrael, when they came out of Aegypt, and were now in the wilderneſſe, and <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his hoaſt ſo purſued them, that he had them at this diſaduantage, that the great mountaines were on both ſides of them, the terrible red ſea was before them, to hinder all paſſage, and he and his great armie mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched after them to deſtroy them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.10.</note> as it is ſet downe in the booke of Exodus: whereupon they were all ſore afraid when they ſaw them, and cried vnto the Lord; but yet they had no aſſurance that he did heare them, and would deliuer them: but rather they looked to be deſtroyed, and ſo through impatience and vnbeleefe did murmure
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:7191:143"/> againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he had brought them out of Aegypt. <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo he crieth vnto the Lord for helpe, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth aſſurance of it for them all, that God would ſaue them, and deſtroy their enemies. For the Lord ſpake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and told him, how he ſhould diuide the ſea, and goe through it, and ſo eſcape, and the Aegyptians ſhould follow them and be drowned: and thereupon he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth comfortably vnto them, <hi>Feare yee not, ſtand ſtill,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſe 13.</note> 
                  <hi>and behold the ſaluation of the Lord, which hee will ſhew to you this day: for the Aegiptians whom yee haue ſeene this day, yee ſhall neuer ſee them againe: the Lord ſhall fight for you, therefore hold you your peace:</hi> and ſo it came to paſſe, as appeareth in the ſame chapter. Thus in this great multitude of many thouſands, when all were partakers of all common dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and feare, and ſo prayed all together for one thing, God gaue to one of them for the reſt, euen to <hi>Moſes</hi> for all the people, this aſſurance of faith, that he could and did ſay, <hi>I know that God doth heare vs, and will helpe vs;</hi> and the reſt though they could not attaine vnto it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, yet they were partakers of the fruit of his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; not onely in that they were deliuered as well as himſelfe, but they had ſome aſſurance of it before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand from him, otherwiſe they could not haue done as they did, ſo confidently to aduenture through the ſea. So may it come to paſſe with vs, if we be in any common danger with others, and haue ſome excellent men among vs to pray with vs, God may giue them that aſſurance of deliuerance according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their faith, which we in our weakeneſſe cannot attaine vnto: and yet ſuch is the fruit of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints, that we ſhall inioy the benefit of it, and be comforted by it: whereas if we were without them, we could not haue it at all; as the Iſraelites could not haue had any comfort here in their diſtreſſe, if they had bene ſome few of them, or many together, for the Lord reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it onely to <hi>Moſes,</hi> though it were for their ſakes alſo.</p>

And beſides he may be of that great wiſedome, and ſo know the meaſure of his ſtrength, and what is fit for ſuch a purpoſe, that he may ſay whiles they are about it, or before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, Now I know that the thing is ouercome, or as good as done: when others ſhall feare that they ſhall doe no great matter, or are like neuer to preuaile: and ſo they ſhall not onely obtaine their purpoſe by his meanes, but by his wordes be encouraged in the doing of it, yea comforted before they begin. So is it when many of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall faith pray together. Therefore as it is well for them that ſhall haue ſuch ſtrong men in their company, to labour with them: ſo ſhall it be much more happy for thoſe that ſhall haue them that are now weake in faith to pray for them.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſayd of that that befell the Iewes in
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:7191:145"/> the dayes of king <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> as it is ſet downe in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke of the Chronicles,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 32.1.</note> where firſt it is ſaid, that <hi>Saneherib</hi> king of Aſhur, when he came vp againſt Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem with a great hoſt, they were all afraid of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: but at laſt this good king getteth by prayer more aſſurance of faith, then the reſt, and ſo bad his nobles and people not feare him:<note place="margin">Verſe 7. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had aſſurance of Gods helpe for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of all his people.</note> ſaying, <hi>Be ſtrong and couragious, feare not, neither be afraid for the king of Asſhur, neither for all the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude that is with him: for there bee more with vs than bee with him: with him is an arme of fleſh, but with vs is the Lord our God to helpe vs, and to fight our battels:</hi> and then it is ſaid that the people were comforted by his words; inſinuating that they were wauering, and doubtfull before. Now that he came to this aſſurance by prayer, there is no doubt, though there be no mention of it in theſe words: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the Lord doth thus vnuſually giue it, (as hath beene ſeene before) this good king in this diſtreſſe we may be aſſured did not neglect it: eſpecially when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the ſame chapter there is mention made of his prayer. Thus the king for himſelfe and for the reſt had this aſſured vnto him, that he knew, that God would helpe them, ſo was not only comforted himſelfe, but comforted others in this great feare. Afterwards it fell out, that when the daunger increaſed, and his faith ſomewhat fayled, he receiued this benefit of comfort in his feare from another, euen for the Prophet <hi>Iſaijah:</hi> For it is ſaid,<note place="margin">And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had it for the comfort of the king. Verſe 20.</note> that after this the king of Asſhur ſent his cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Rabſakeh,</hi> who with great threatning and rayling wordes ſought to terrifie the people, who to that end cried out vnto them vpon the wall in the Iewiſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. Then <hi>Hezekiah</hi> the king, and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet prayed againſt this, and cryed to heauen: but it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that the king for all this had yet no great aſſurance in himſelfe, that God would deliuer him: but <hi>Iſaiah</hi> that prayed with him had it for him and for the reſt, and did comfort him. For it is thus written of <hi>Hezehiah,</hi> that he
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:7191:145"/> went into the houſe of the Lord to pray, and ſent meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers to the Prophet, to deſire him,<note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 19.1.</note> that he would do ſo to: and ſo he did, and thereupon ſent him this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, (which aſſurance God gaue him by prayer for the reſt) <hi>That he ſhould not feare his words,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſe. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>for he would ſend a blaſt vpon him, and he ſhould heare a noyſe, and ſhould returne into his owne land, and there he ſhould die by the ſword,</hi> as it alſo came to paſſe. And here though hee was a Prophet to whom God ſhewed many things extraordinarily, yet he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared him for that worke of his ſpirit: and prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one ſpeciall meanes to make vs fit to receiue any grace of the ſpirit; here it is ſaid that he prayed, and had this aſſurance. And ſo here in this diſtreſſe many praying together, the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> onely for all the reſt ſayth, <hi>Now know I, that the Lord will heare and helpe vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before this I ſhould haue placed the example of that good king <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> (which is ſet downe alſo in the ſame booke of the Chronicles) both becauſe it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this in order of time, and eſpecially becauſe it is moſt fit for this purpoſe.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 20 2. <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> praying for helpe againſt his enemies, one of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it for all the reſt.</note> For in his dayes a great hoaſt of the Ammonites, and Moabites, and out of mount Seir, came vp againſt Ieruſalem: which did ſo terrifie him, and all the reſt of his people, that he ſet himſelfe to feare the Lord, and proclaimed a faſt through all Iudah, and they all gathered themſelues together, to aske counſell of the Lord, and they came vp out of all cities of Iudah to inquire of the Lord: and <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> was in this congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in the houſe of the Lord, and there in the midſt of them made a feruent prayer vnto God for helpe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: ſaying, <hi>O Lord God of our fathers, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſe 14.</note> as it is ſet downe at large there. And it is further added, that there was one <hi>Iahaziel</hi> a Leuit, and vpon him, after, or in the time of this prayer, came the ſpirit of the Lord in the middeſt of the Congregation, and hee ſaid, <hi>Hearken ye all Iudah, and you inhabitants of Ieruſalem, and thou king Iehoſhaphat, Thus ſayth the Lord vnto you: feare not, neither be afraid of this
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:7191:146"/> great multitude, for the battell is not yours, but Gods: to morrow go you down and meet with them in ſuch a place, ye ſhall not need to fight in this battell, stand ſtill, moue not, and behold the ſaluation of the Lord towards you:</hi> &amp; again very confidently he biddeth them <hi>not feare, but go out againſt them, &amp; the Lord would be with them:</hi> and ſo it came to paſſe, as appeareth in the ſame chapter: for the Lord layd ambuſhments againſt them, ſo that the children of <hi>Amon</hi> and <hi>Moab</hi> roſe againſt the inhabitants of mount Seir,<note place="margin">Verſ. 22.</note> to ſlay and deſtroy them; &amp; when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, euery one helped to deſtroy another. Here we ſee alſo in this common danger and feare, when many prayed together, there was one man at the leaſt, to whom God gaue this aſſurance, to the great comfort of all the reſt, that he did openly ſay, <hi>Now I know that the Lord will heare his anointed, and helpe him from heauen by the mightie power of his right hand.</hi> And though others in that companie could not ſay ſo, yet God gaue it to him for all the reſt; who if he had beene wanting, the reſt might ſtill haue langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in their feare, vnleſſe God had raiſed vp the ſpirit of ſome other.<note place="margin">In this reſpect we ought to make of the companie and preſence of the godly.</note> And ſo wee ſee what a bleſſed thing it was to haue ſuch a faithfull and zealous man in their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, to pray for them. Therefore let vs make much of the company of the godly, eſpecially let vs be deſirous to be partakers of their prayers: that when as we be weake our ſelues, and diſcomforted in our ſelues, yet we may be ſtrengthened and vpheld by them. For as when one lyeth very ſicke and like to die, and all about him are in feare of it, there may be a skilfull Phiſition, or ſome of great experience, who may ſee great tokens of life in him more than all the reſt, &amp; ſo comfort them in hope of it, when they are all diſcouraged: So when many are in trouble, and looke for no way but one, as we ſay, the Lord may ſo open the eyes of the mind of one, who by faith after earneſt prayer, may ſee into that helpe that God hath promiſed in his word, and comfort them with
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:7191:146"/> the hope of it. And for want of this, we are many times more diſmayed in trouble, than otherwiſe we might be. Therefore in all affliction, if wee deſire comfort from God, let vs deſire thoſe that are faithfull and godly to pray with vs and for vs.</p>
               <p>It followeth in the words of the text,<note place="margin">His annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that is, <hi>Dauid,</hi> &amp; why ſo called.</note> that <hi>The Lord will helpe his annointed.</hi> This is then further to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that <hi>Dauid</hi> prayeth himſelfe, and teacheth the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alſo ſo to doe, <hi>That God would helpe his annointed:</hi> by which word he meaneth himſelfe, and they meane <hi>Dauid</hi> their king. VVho is ſo called, becauſe he was annointed with holy oyle, to be king, according to the cuſtome of that time: by which as by an outward viſible ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, they that were made kings, were ſeperated and put apart from the reſt of the people, and inueſted into that office and high calling. VVherby alſo they were taught to labour for thoſe gifts of the holy ghoſt, which were needfull for that function: and to beleeue, that if they did ſo, God would beſtow them vpon them in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that was moſt conuenient for them. Now that <hi>Dauid</hi> was thus annointed to that office, it is moſt euident in his ſtorie: where it is ſaid, that when <hi>Saule</hi> by diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods commaundement, in not killing the Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites, was caſt off from the right of the kingdome, and <hi>Samuel</hi> was willed to goe tell him ſo:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. Chap. 16.1.</note> he ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued mourning for him, vntill the Lord did reprooue him for it; and bad him fill his horne with oyle, and he would ſend him to <hi>Iſhai</hi> the Bethleemite, for hee had prouided a king among his ſonnes: and he did ſo, and cauſed all his ſonnes to come before him from the eldeſt to the youngeſt, and when <hi>Dauid</hi> came, the Lord ſaid vnto him, <hi>Ariſe and annoint him, for this is he:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>then Samuel tooke the horne of oyle, and annointed him in the middest of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: and the spirit of the Lord came vpon Dauid from that day forward, euen as it departed from Saule, being cast off of God, and an euill spirit was ſent of the Lord to vex him.</hi> Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:7191:147"/> was annointed, that is, made king. And becauſe this was not onely ouer the people of God, but ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the commaundement of God, therefore hee is called his annointed, that is, one appointed to be king ouer Gods people by the Lord himſelfe: euen as <hi>Dauid</hi> doth oftentimes call <hi>Saule</hi> in reſpect of his firſt annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and calling, <hi>The Lords annointed.</hi> As when hee had <hi>Saule</hi> in a caue, and his men perſuaded him to kill him, he ſaid, <hi>The Lord keepe me from doing that thing vnto my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.7.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lords annointed, to lay mine hands vpon him, for hee is the annointed of the Lord:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap 26.9.</note> and at another time hee ſaid to <hi>Abiſhai, Destroy him not, for who can lay his hands on the Lords annointed, and be guiltleſse?</hi> In this part of the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then hee doth aſſure himſelfe, that becauſe hee had not intruded himſelfe into that roome,<note place="margin">He confirmeth his faith in Gods defence by the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his calling.</note> but was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called thereunto by the Lord, that therefore God would defend him in the ſame againſt his enemies: and teacheth them to pray in that faith alſo, That ſeeing God had ſet him ouer them to be their king, and he was no tyrant or vſurper, that therefore God would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue him in that place, whereunto he had called him: and ſo from the lawfulneſſe of his calling, hee doth comfort himſelfe and them, that God would heare them for him, and defend him. And truly, there was great reaſon of that: for if an earthly king, when he appointeth any to be iudges ouer his people, doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo protect them in that office by his lawes, and by all his ſubiects: ſo that in their whole circuit they haue the Sherife of the Shire, and all his men, with the reſt of the chiefe knights and gentlemen, and other infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour officers to attend vpon them, becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the kings perſon; and the Iudge he comforteth himſelfe in all his lawfull affaires againſt all the deſperat attempts of theeues, witches, murtherers, and all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors, that ſeeke to hurt him, That the king, who hath called him to that place, will defend him in it, and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:7191:147"/> not ſuffer him to ſuſtaine any dammage for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his office: then the Lord, the king of kings, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing <hi>Dauid</hi> in this place, and making him to be his vicegerent vpon earth ouer that people, much more would defend him in it againſt his enemies. And as this was true, ſo he did beleeue it, and taught them ſo to do, and to pray in that faith, that God would ſend helpe vnto him, becauſe he was his annointed.</p>
               <p>And this that <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayth here,<note place="margin">So may al law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full princes.</note> is true not onely of his owne perſon, but of all other kings and princes that are the Lords annointed; that is, who are come to their kingdomes lawfully, either by free election, or lineall diſcent, and ſo are put in by God; it is true I ſay, that the Lord will defend them in all their lawfull attempts which they take in hand by vertue of their office, ſo farre as may make for his glorie and the good of his Church. And in that reſpect, all people that haue ſuch ſet ouer them to raigne, may with great freedome and comfort pray for them, That the Lord would defend them in all dangers, euen as hee hath ſet them ouer them at the firſt. Therfore ſeeing the Lord hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed vs this mercie, to giue vs ſuch a worthie king to raigne ouer vs, who is his annointed, that is, one that commeth to the crowne not by vſurpation, by murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the right heires, as ſome haue done; not by tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall inuaſion and conqueſt, but by inheritance, line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deſcending from his auntient progenitors, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kings of this realme: therefore, I ſay, we may with great aſſurance pray to God for him;<note place="margin">In this reſpect we may with great hope pray for the life of our king. <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 28.2.</note> that as hee hath hetherto ouerthrowne the plots of traytors in his owne countrey of Scotland, and in this kingdom alſo of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land (both of them his iuſt inheritance) ſo it would pleaſe him to doe ſtill; and ſo he will doe, if our ſinnes doe not deſerue the contrarie: <hi>For many times becauſe of the ſinnes of the people, a land often changeth her princes,</hi> as the VViſeman ſaith: and as we ſee in the kingdome of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:7191:148"/> falling vnto idolatrie,<note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 16.8.</note> that in the ſpace of one yeare they had three or foure kings ſucceſsiuely to raigne ouer them. Therefore ſeeing it is our bounden dutie to pray for him,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1.</note> according to the doctrine of the Apoſtle, who willeth, <hi>That ſupplications, and prayers, interceſsions, and giuing of thankes be made for all men; and namely, for kings, and all that are in authoritie:</hi> let vs be willing to doe it the rather, becauſe he is the Lords annointed, that is, come to the crowne by all lawfull and peaceable meanes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued in the law of God, that ſo wee may ſay from thence, <hi>I know that the Lord will helpe his annointed.</hi> So that though we could haue no comfort from our ſelues, that we ſhould be found worthie of ſuch a prince; yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it hath pleaſed the Lord in the riches of his mercie to ſet him ouer vs for the good of this land, wee may hope, that he will haue reſpect vnto his annointed, and not to ſuffer men to put downe him, whom he himſelfe hath ſet vp. Euen as we had great experience of this in the dayes of our late Soueraigne the Queene, how the Lord did miraculouſly preſerue her out of the hands of the Papiſts her enemies, when ſhe was caſt into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and as ſhe then ſaid of her ſelfe <hi>(Tanquam eius)</hi> as a ſheepe, euery houre readie to be carried to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and at the laſt brought her to the kingdome: ſo in the ſame he did as wonderfully preſerue her in many dangers and conſpiracies, becauſe ſhee was his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> in many troubles pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in hope of Gods defence, becauſe he was his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And thus <hi>Dauid</hi> doth often comfort himſelfe in his prayers, when hee was in great trouble, and in feare of the loſſe ſometimes both of his kingdome and life: and that both before he came to the crowne, and after, he comforteth himſelfe with this, That he was the Lords annointed, that is, that <hi>Samuel</hi> did annoint him to bee king, by the commaundement of God; and that that was not done vnto him in vaine, but that the Lord, who had called him vnto it, would both bring him to it in
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:7191:148"/> time, and defend him in it to the end. As when hee was kept from the publicke aſſemblies by <hi>Saule,</hi> and his great crueltie, who neuer left ſeeking after his life, but hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after him continually,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.20.</note> as a man would after a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge (as he ſayth of himſelfe) whereupon he was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſometimes to hide himſelfe, and ſometimes to flie out of the land, and very ſeldome durſt be ſeene openly, he prayeth thus, <hi>O Lord God of hoſtes heare my prayer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.8.</note> 
                  <hi>hearken O God of Iaakob: behold O God our ſhield, and looke vpon the face of thine annointed:</hi> that is, not onely and principally vpon thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, the Meſsiah, who is appointed to be king and ſauiour of the Church, and for his ſake doe it: but looke vpon me whom thou haſt appointed to be king, and (as thou knoweſt) I haue not thruſt in my ſelfe, for then I might well thinke that all this were iuſtly come vpon mee.

               </p>
               <p>And this aſſurance of our calling muſt not onely a little comfort vs at the firſt, but in the whole courſe and miniſterie of the ſame, and in all things that ſhall befall vs in the execution of it: that we may with a good conſcience pray vnto God, that as wee haue not intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded our ſelues, neither haue had our calling onely from men, but from him, ſo he would heare vs, and helpe vs in all things that we doe according to the ſame. And as no doubt there is great comfort in this, that a man is thus aſſured of his calling, and without this he may often be diſmaid: ſo in that reſpect it is requiſit,<note place="margin">It is requiſit therefore that euery one ſhould be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuaded of the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> that not onely they, but all others in their ſeuerall places ſhould be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that they haue their callings of God, that ſo they may in faith pray for his defence. For this cauſe we ſee how immediatly from God the Prophets had their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, to whom God ſpake, and appeared in viſions, as to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and to <hi>Ieremie,</hi> and the reſt; how the Iudges were rayſed vp extraordinarily, that in their great attempts they might be aſſured, that God had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them to that place:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iudg.</hi> 6.37.</note> and eſpecially how carefull <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon</hi> was of it, by making triall twiſe in a fleece of woll. And how <hi>Paule</hi> and all the reſt of the Apoſtles were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led immediatly by Chriſt: that when they ſhould meet with ſo many incomberances as they did, they might not doubt of their calling, and ſo of Gods protection. And ſo againe what order was ſet downe by God, both for the ſucceſsion of the Prieſts and Leuits, and for their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall offices and places: and what for the ſucceſsion of the kings: and what in the new Teſtament is for the choiſe of miniſters: and what in the ſcripture for magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates: that ſo all might thereby be aſſured, that they haue their callings from God, when they are ſo qualited
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:7191:151"/> for them, as he hath required in his word: and when they came to them by ſuch lawfull choiſe as he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. That ſo euery one doing that which God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of them in the ſame, they might as any trouble ſhall come vpon them, or any difficultie ſhall befall them, they might, I ſay, with comfort, and in faith pray, that God would heare, and helpe them, they being his anointed; that is, come to thoſe places by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.<note place="margin">Euen vnto the meaneſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſeruant.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And this as it is requiſit in euery calling or ſtate of life that one is in, euen vnto the meaneſt, to be perſuaded, That they are placed in them by God; ſo there is great comfort therein, whatſoeuer ſhall befall them in the ſame. As the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the calling of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.17.</note> and of being called vnto the eſtate of marriage, and ſaith of them, and of all others generally, <hi>That as God hath distributed to euery man, and as the Lord hath called euery one, ſo let him walke, and ſo ordaine I in all Churches.</hi> VVhere he warneth euery man generally to liue with a contented mind in the Lord, what ſtate or condition of life ſo euer he be in: and therfore he telleth him, that it is that trade of life, which God hath diſtributed vnto them, &amp; which he hath called them vnto. So that a ſeruant muſt be perſuaded,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephe.</hi> 6.6.</note> that God hath called him to that place, and therefore as he muſt make conſcience of doing faithfull ſeruice, not to the eye, as men pleaſers, but as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of Chriſt, doing the will of God from the heart, with good will ſeruing the Lord, and not men, as he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the Epheſians: So alſo from this perſuaſion of his calling, hee may pray vnto God to defend him againſt all wrongs,<note place="margin">Verſ. 8.</note> and to aſsiſt him in all things: euen as Saint <hi>Paule</hi> in the ſame place biddeth to that end know, <hi>That whatſoeuer good thing any man doth, the ſame ſhall he receiue of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.</hi> So that ſeruants being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of the lawfulneſſe of their calling, and of their owne fidelitie in the ſame, may pray to God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:7191:151"/> them for their good ſeruice, and to defend them in a good cauſe againſt any abuſes that their maſter ſhall offer vnto them. And ſo for the other eſtate of life,<note place="margin">And of being called to the ſtate of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> that he ſpeaketh of there: if any be called vnto mariage, they muſt not onely be perſuaded of the lawfulneſſe of it, and that God hath called them vnto it, but alſo that he hath ioyned them together; this man to this woman, as <hi>Eue</hi> in paradiſe was ioyned to <hi>Adam</hi> by the immediat hand of God: and ſo that they came not together by fortune or chance, or by the will and conſent of their friends, or by their own choice only, but by God, &amp; that their marriage was firſt made in heauen, before it was ſolemniſed vpon earth: and therfore that they are in that place that God hath called them vnto. Then may they with comfort pray for all ſuch gifts as are needfull for thoſe places; as in doing of their duties, that the Lord would preſerue them from all croſſes that might befall them, and aſsiſt them in them; and generally that he would heare their prayers, and ſend them helpe from heauen: as the people doe here.</p>
               <p>And to conclude this point,<note place="margin">In all actions of our life we ought to be perſuaded, that God hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vs vnto them.</note> we muſt all of vs be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded in the whole courſe of our liues, that whatſo-we doe, we haue a calling to it from God; and ſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are his anointed, that is, appointed of God for it. VVhich we ſhall ordinarily know by this, that the thing it ſelfe is good in it owne nature, and agreeable to the word of God, and commanded there: and then, that by vertue of our places that we be in, God requireth them of vs, and that that time and place doth alſo require them: for all things are not required of all men alike, nor at all times, and in all places. Then hauing this perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the word of God, though they be dangerous, and full of trouble, and ſuch as might diſcourage vs, we may confidently pray vnto God, to aſsiſt vs, and defend vs therein, and to helpe vs in all affliction that ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall vs for the ſame. And thus <hi>Dauid</hi> here being a king,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:7191:152"/> was to defend his ſubiects, and therefore their enemies comming againſt them to battell, he goeth forth, and aduentureth himſelfe to the warre: and thus prayeth vnto God, and willeth the people to pray for him in this good action, whereunto he was lawfully called: and God did heare their prayers, and gaue them good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. In like manner, that famous and worthy Queene <hi>Hester,</hi> after that <hi>Mordecai</hi> had ſent vnto her the copie of the kings letter, that was ſent abroad by poſtes for the rooting out of the Iewes in one day, and willed her to goe in to the king, and make requeſt for the life of her people: at the firſt, ſhe like a fearefull woman drew backe, and excuſed her ſelfe, ſaying, <hi>All the kings ſeruants, and all the people of the prouinces know,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heſter.</hi> 4.11.</note> 
                  <hi>that whoſoeuer, man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Then may we haue bould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in them though they be neuer ſo dangerous,</note> 
                  <hi>that commeth to the king into the inner court, which is not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, there is a law of his, that he ſhall die, except to him, whom the king holdeth out the golden rod, that he may liue: now I haue not beene called to come to the king, theſe thirtie dayes.</hi> Then <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſent her word againe, that ſhe muſt not thinke to eſcape in the kings houſe more than all the Iewes; but if ſhe did hould her peace at this time, deliuerance ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to the Iewes out of another place, but ſhe and her fathers houſe ſhould periſh: and who knew, whether ſhe was come to the kingdome for ſuch a time. Thus when he had perſuaded her by good reaſon, that God did require it at her hands, and that ſhe was rayſed vp out of a meane place to ſuch an high dignitie by the Lord for ſuch a purpoſe, and that God would require it at her hands, if ſhe failed in it; ſhee aduentureth her ſelfe, though it was very dangerous, with this reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſeeing God had called her vnto it, he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her in it: but howſoeuer it ſhould fall out, ſhee would commit her ſelfe in this cauſe to his bleſſed prouidence, contented to be ordered by his will; <hi>I will goe in to the king, which is not according to the law: and if I periſh, I periſh.</hi> But in the meane ſeaſon hauing this
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:7191:152"/> faith in this action, ſhe prayeth to God, to aſsiſt her, to guide her, to direct her, and to bleſſe her; and willeth all the people to doe ſo likewiſe: ſaying, <hi>Goe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſe. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>and aſsemble all the Iewes that are found in Shuſhan, and faſt yee for me, and eate not, nor drinke in three dayes, day nor night; I alſo and my maids will fast likewiſe.</hi> And ſo they did, and God heard their prayer, and did not forſake her in this thing, whereunto he had called her.</p>
               <p>Thus in a matter of great moment, which was full alſo of great difficultie, and wherein ſhe did hazard her life; being perſuaded, that God had called her vnto it, ſhe prayeth for her ſelfe, and others alſo for her, that God would helpe her, and heare her in heauen; and he did ſo.<note place="margin">Thus did <hi>Iaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kob</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous voyage whereunto God had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him.</note> VVhich is written for our inſtruction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, to ſhew vs, what wee ſhould doe; and in doing, what we may looke for from God, in the like caſe. And from hence alſo did <hi>Iaakob</hi> comfort himſelfe in the like danger, and this was the ground of his prayer; who in his retunrne from <hi>Laban,</hi> did heare that his brother <hi>Eſau</hi> came againſt him with foure hundred men: then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring his former threats was greatly afraid, and ſore troubled; and after other things that he did for the defence and ſafegard of his companie, he prayeth vnto God after this manner, <hi>O God of my father Abraham,</hi>

For in a figuratiue ſpeech, by the right hand of God is meant the ſtrength and power of God: becauſe that as man commonly hath moſt ſtrength in his right hand, ſo to our capacitie and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding (though the Lord be a ſpirit, and hath no bodie, and ſo conſequently no hand) yet the Scripture attributeth vnto him an arme, an hand, and a right hand: as when it is ſaid in the Pſalme,<note place="margin">

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:7191:154"/> of his ſeruants, might be ſhewed by infinit exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the Scriptures: as how <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his great hoſt was drowned in the red ſea, when his owne people had a paſſage through it on drie foot, (which we ſpake of euen now:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioſhu.</hi> 6.20.</note>) how he cauſed the walles of Iericho (when the Iſraelites layd ſiege to it) to fall flat downe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any batterie, onely at the ſound of trumpets: how he ouerthrew in the hoaſt of proud <hi>Saneherib</hi> one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred foureſcore and fiue thouſand, in one night: and by many ſuch like things. But this is, or ſhould be well knowne vnto vs; for this is the firſt article of our faith, <hi>That wee beleeue in God the father almightie, maker of heauen and earth:</hi> that is, who by his mightie power hath made all things in heauen and in earth of nothing, and therefore he can bring them all to nought againe; and without him they can doe nothing,<note place="margin">How by the conſideration of it, we ought to ſtrengthen our faith.</note> as hee without them, and againſt them can doe all things. Onely we had need to be put in mind to make that good vſe of it in the time of our trouble, that <hi>Dauid</hi> doth here; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that thereby we labour to ſtrengthen our faith, in the defence of God: and that we beleeue, that as he doth heare vs, ſo he can and will helpe vs. And the more that any thing is againſt vs to weaken our faith, the more muſt we by the meditation of the mightie power of God, indeuour to ſtrengthen the ſame; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that his power ſhall be made perfect, and more cleerely be ſeene in our weakeneſſe.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And thus did <hi>Abraham,</hi> the father of all the faithfull, when the Lord had promiſed vnto him, that his wife <hi>Sarah</hi> ſhould haue a ſonne, when they were both old and ſtricken in yeares, and was paſt hope of any by the courſe of nature: For the ſpirit of God beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of him, <hi>That aboue hope he beleeued vnder hope,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18.</note> 
                  <hi>that he ſhould be the father of many nations,</hi> as it was ſaid vnto him. And hee did not by vnbeleefe reaſon againſt this, by
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:7191:155"/> conſidering the deadneſſe of his owne bodie, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt an hundred yeare old, nor the deadneſſe of <hi>Saraes</hi> wombe: but gaue glorie to God, That he that had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed,<note place="margin">As the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God haue done.</note> was able to performe it. Thus hee conſidered of the mightie helpe of Gods right hand, and ſtayed his faith vpon that: and ſo muſt we doe in all things that God hath promiſed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 9 29.</note> and then wee ſhall find, <hi>That</hi> (as Chriſt ſayth in the Goſpell) <hi>it ſhall be vnto vs according to our faith.</hi> But more fitly for this purpoſe may wee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what great vſe that good king <hi>Hezekiah</hi> made of the knowledge that hee had of Gods omnipotent power: euen that it did maruellouſly ſtrengthen his faith in prayer againſt the mightie power of the great hoaſt of <hi>Saneherib</hi> (which was come vp againſt him) and againſt all the deſperat and blaſphemous threats which he gaue out againſt him:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jſai.</hi> 37.16.</note> as it is ſet downe by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> where hee thus prayeth, <hi>O Lord of hoſtes, thou are very God alone ouer all the kingdomes of the earth; thou hast made the heauen, and the earth. Incline thine eare, O Lord, and heare: open thine eyes, O Lord, and ſee, and heare all the words of Saneherib, who hath ſent to blaspheme the liuing God. Truth it is, O Lord, that the kings of Asſhur haue deſtroyed all lands, and their countrey: and haue caſt the gods in the fire, for they were no gods, but the worke of mens hands, euen wood and ſtone: therefore they deſtroyed them. Now therefore O Lord our God, ſaue thou vs out of his hand, that all the kingdomes of the earth may know, that thou onely art the Lord.</hi> Thus the ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Gods great power did make him not onely not to be daunted by the power of his aduerſarie, but cauſed him with great hope of preuailing to pray ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly vnto God againſt it.</p>
               <p>And vnto this may bee ioyned the example of that worthie king <hi>Aſa,</hi> one of his predeceſſours, who in like caſe, to vphold his faith againſt the feare of his mightie and many enemies, did meditate vpon the omnipotent
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:7191:155"/> power of Gods right hand.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 14 9.</note> For when the king of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyopia came out againſt him with ten hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, beſides chariots and horſes, he went out alſo againſt him, and did meet with him, and did ſet the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell in array, and then cried vnto the Lord his God,<note place="margin">Conſidering Gods power, not ſo much in himſelfe, as for their owne defence.</note> that is, prayed earneſtly and in faith, ſaying, <hi>Lord, it is nothing with thee to helpe with many, or with no power: helpe vs O Lord our God; for we reſt in thee, and in thy name are we come againſt this great multitude: O Lord thou art our God, let not man preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee.</hi> VVhere we ſee how he doth not conſider of the power of God, as ſhut vp in himſelfe, but as that which was readie to be ſhewed in their defence againſt their enemies, as <hi>Dauid</hi> doth here. And indeed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth true faith in the power of God, That we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that he is almightie to helpe vs, and therefore that we pray to him accordingly: as <hi>Dauid</hi> teacheth the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple here to doe; and to ſay, <hi>Now know I, that the Lord will helpe his annointed, by the mightie power of his right hand.</hi> And thus wee perceiue what vſe wee ſhould make of that which wee read euery where in the Scriptures, of the great power of God, namely, that wee might depend vpon him in all troubles, and pray vnto him in faith, not doubting but as he doth heare vs, ſo he will helpe vs by his great power.</p>
               <p>But let vs examine our ſelues, I pray you, and wee ſhall ſee how farre wee are from this great meaſure of faith, that ſo wee might labour to grow therein: for how hardly, or not at all, do we come to this,<note place="margin">Few in trouble do reſt vpon the power of God, ſo weake is their faith.</note> To reſt in the inuiſible power of God? Let a man bee in trouble, and come and tell him of the great power of God, and how he is able to helpe him, and ſo bid him be of good comfort, and pray vnto God, and depend vpon him; and we ſhall find, that he can be contented to doe ſo, ſo farre foorth as hee can ſee how and which way God ſhould helpe him. But for a man when he hath no meanes at all,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:7191:156"/> or very few to doe himſelfe good by, then to ſay as <hi>Aſa</hi> did, <hi>It is all one with God to helpe with many or with no power:</hi> and ſo to pray as earneſtly and as confidently, as though he had all the meanes in the world: as it is ſaid of him, that he then cried vnto the Lord his God, that is, prayed with great feruencie. This, I ſay, is not to bee found in euery one that boaſteth of faith. Nay (which is a great thing) when we ſhall ſee more to be againſt vs than with vs, and more meanes to diſcourage vs from the hope of that that we deſire, than to giue vs comfort in it; then to paſſe by them all, and not to ſtand reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from them againſt our ſelues by vnbeleefe; and not to ſay, I cannot bee holpen, becauſe I haue theſe and theſe things againſt mee: but to breake through them all, and to giue this glorie to God, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, that he that promiſed,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>That if we call vpon him in the time of our trouble, he will heare vs and deliuer vs, is able to performe it:</hi> and ſo to ſay, as <hi>Dauid</hi> doth here, <hi>I know, that hee will helpe me by the mightie ſtrength of his right hand;</hi> is that faith, which as it will vphold vs in all troubles, ſo it is to bee found in very few. But let vs remember for the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of vs this way,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.1.</note> 
                  <hi>That faith</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſayth) <hi>is of things that are hoped for, and not ſeene:</hi> and therefore as we beleeue God to be preſent euery where, though we ſee him not; ſo muſt we beleeue that God is able to helpe vs, though wee cannot ſee how or which way; and ſo pray to him in all wants, and ſay, I know, that though I am weake, and cannot helpe my ſelfe, yet hee will helpe me by his mightie power: and this the more we can doe it in truth, though in great weakeneſſe, the more ſhall wee glorifie God, and the more will hee helpe vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The great power of God in rayſing vp them that are ſicke.</note>Therefore let them know, that are viſited with ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, either of the peſtilence or otherwiſe, that if they were brought ſo low that they were at deaths doore,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:7191:156"/> God is able to recouer them, and to raiſe them vp again by his great power, as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſayth vnto <hi>Iob,</hi> when hee was ſo full of ſores in his bodie, that he deſired not life, neither had any hope of it: ſayth he,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>If a man be stricken with ſorrow vpon his head, and the griefe of his bones is ſore; ſo that his life cauſeth him to abhorre bread, and his ſoule daintie meat; his fleſh faileth, that it cannot be ſeene, and his bones, which were not ſeene, clatter; ſo his ſoule draweth to the graue, and his life to the buriers; if there be a meſſenger of God with him, an interpreter of his word, who is as one of a thouſand, to declare vnto man his righteouſneſſe: then will he haue mercie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and ſay, Deliuer him, that he goe not downe into the pit, for I haue receiued a reconciliation: then ſhall his fleſh bee as freſh as a childs, and ſhall returne, as in the dayes of his youth.</hi> Thus wee ſee, that if a man bee readie to giue vp the ghoſt, and the bell be rong for him, and they begin to prepare things for his buriall, if the Lord do but ſpeake the word, he ſhall bee reſtored to life and health.<note place="margin">
